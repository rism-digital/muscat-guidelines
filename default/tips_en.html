<p><b>1. How can I add images?</b></p>

<p><span>Small
images such as watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings can be attached to
the record directly from the editing mode: click on <b>Attach a new image</b> on the menu on the right.</span></p>



<p><span>Images such
as digitized resources should only be added as links that link to the holding
repository. These are added in the field <b>External
resource (856)</b>.</span></p>
