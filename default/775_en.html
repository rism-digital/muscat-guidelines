<p>The phrases "Initial
entry" and "Following entries" correspond to the suborder
adopted in the printed volumes of series A/I, in which identical contents were
indicated with a dash beneath the first printed edition mentioned. Most of
these had a complete title. This system did not correspond to any hierarchy in
a sense of first editions and reprints. However, linking is necessary in that
similarities in content of the titles have to be reflected. Furthermore, since
the subsequent entries often lack short and/or original titles, there needs to
be a clear reference to the (original) title of the first entry.<br></p><br>
