**Scope of printed music in RISM**

RISM seeks to document printed music from the beginnings of music printing through around 1900.

In the course of the 20th century and up to today, we see a sharp increase in commercial music publishing and distribution. The amount of music considered "rare" or undocumented elsewhereis much less when compared to previous centuries. Music published by modern publishers, printed in large quantities, widely available, and meant for active use by library patrons would be better documented in cooperative databases such as [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/).

RISM will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether to document music published in the 20th century by defunct publishers or by smaller, regional publishers of historical significance; as well as modern editions included in the course of cataloging a collection with historical value, such as the private library of an individual.
