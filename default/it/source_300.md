### Physical description (300)

**Required field.**

The field **Physical description** provides a clear declaration of the material preserved by stating the format (such as score or parts) and how many there are. If you have parts, this field is used in conjunction with the field **Parts held and extent (590)**, in which the specific parts are named.

#### Format, extent (300 $a)

For all types of formats except parts, the field **Format, extent (300 $a)** is built up of three components: **Number of items, Format, Extent.**

###### Example
- 1 score: 35 p.

For parts, the field **Format, extent (300 $a)** is built up of two components: **Number of items, Format.** The specific parts are listed separately in the field **Parts held (590)**.

###### Example

- 5 parts

##### Number of items

State the number of items held. Use **X** to indicate an unknown number of items.

##### Format

Use one of the following English terms, in the singluar or plural as appropriate.

###### General

- **part**: The notation of a work for an instrument or voice regardless of the number of staves per system (includes piano, organ, piano four-hands, no matter how many staves). Use also for partbooks.
- **score**: Contains all the instruments and/or voices of a composition, as long as more than one performing force is involved. This includes works for voice and accompaniment.

###### Kinds of scores

- **vocal score**: A work with voices and instruments where the vocal part(s) are present with the accompaniment arranged for a keyboard instrument.
- **keyboard score**: A work for instruments where the instruments are arranged for a keyboard instrument (no vocal parts). Indicate the extent immediately following regardless of the number of staves per system.
- **chorus score**: A work for solo voices, chorus, and instruments where only the music for the chorus is present in score format, omitting any solo vocal parts; an accompaniment reduced for a keyboard instrument may or may not be present.
- **particella**: A sketch or draft of a composition in a short score format.
- **short score**: All other kinds of reduced, condensed, or short scores, or when the kind of reduced score cannot be determined.
- **tablature score**
- **choirbook**: A book in which all voices of a work are written separately so that the choir can read the music from one book. Choirbooks are input as with scores.

###### Special formats

- **tablature part**: The type of tablature, if known, should be named in the field **General note (500)**.
- **sketch**: Use for sketches if the type of format cannot be more precisely determined.
- **text document**: Use for libretti, treatises, and other kinds of text documents. A note in **General note (500)** may be necessary.
- **prompt book**: A document (can be a short score or text) used by a prompter for a stage work.
- **table book**: parts arranged on a page so that all performers can read from it while seated around a table.

###### Other

- **various**: Use for collection parent records if the collection contains different kinds of formats (such as a full score and a keyboard score).
- **other**: Use if none of the above apply. In such cases, include an explanation in the field **General note (500)**. The number of items or the extent is not required.

For conductor part(s), use **part** or **parts** here and enter **conductor part** in the field **Parts held (590)**.

For texted scores, use **with text**, such as **keyboard score with text**. For texted parts, see **Parts held and extent (590)**.

##### Extent

For all formats except parts, enter the number of pages, leaves, or gatherings. Choose among the following abbreviations: **f** for folio, **p** for page, **lvs** for leaves (sheets), and **fds** for folds (gatherings).

For collection parent records as well as for pieces that are not part of collections, the total extent is given, such as **35 p.** If a piece is within a collection, the extent for that piece is given, such as **p. 17-23.**

Use only one method of foliation or pagination within a collection. When using recto and verso enumeration, use both **r** and **v**. Indicate other units (such as the conversion from folios to pages) in the field **General note (500)**.

Do not indicate the extent for parts here. Extent is entered in the field **Parts held (590)**.

###### Examples

- 1 score: 35 p.
- 1 score (2x): 2, 2 f.
- 1 short score: 8 f.
