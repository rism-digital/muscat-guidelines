### Standardized titles – Subject headings

As is stated in the guidelines for **Standardized title (240)**,  the order of preference is when entering a standardized title is: 1) distinctive title, 2) text incipit, 3) genre, 4) tempo marking.  This section expands on the guidelines for the third type of standardized title, genres, and explains its relationship to subject headings.

Genres are used as standardized titles predominantly in instrumental music and in titles for collections. In many cases, the **Standardized title** and the **Subject heading (650)** will be identical, such as with _Symphonies_ or _Sonatas_.

In other cases, however, a corresponding, rather than identical, subject heading is used. A variant subject heading is used especially in the following situations:

- If the same subject heading can be used in both vocal and instrumental genres, an abbreviation in parentheses is added after the genre: **(voc.)** or **(inst.)**, respectively.
- Specifications such as **(dances)** or **(stage)** may also be added in parentheses after the main term.

In other words, a standardized title will be the genre only, and the subject heading will have a parenthetical addition that indicates if it is a vocal or instrumental genre. Parentheses (as well as other punctuation) are never part of standardized titles.  
Examples:
1. An organ canon  
   Standardized title: Canons  
   Subject heading: Canons (inst.)
2. A collection containing 12 arias for voice and orchestra  
   Standardized title: 12 Arias  
   Subject heading: Arias (voc.)

Below are lists of standardized titles and their corresponding subject headings. The lists are not comprehensive, since new subject headings are added to Muscat continuously. The standardized titles and subject headings should be entered in the form given here (usually in English and in the plural) and not in translation. Note the special situations at the end.

Contents:
- General instrumental and vocal music
