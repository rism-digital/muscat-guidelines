### Source of description note (588)

This field specifies which physical item was consulted for cataloging a printed edition (for both new and enhanced records).

Enter the library siglum and shelfmark of the printed edition consulted. You can also indicate if you used a copy for only a portion of the record, such as incipits or individual entries.

If you use a secondary source as a basis for the record, fill out this field as usual but specify the secondary source in a **General note (500)** and link to it as a catalog of works or bibliographic reference.

- **General note (500)**: Record based on YouV using the description of the copy in GB-Lbl, shelfmark h.11.a.(1.).
