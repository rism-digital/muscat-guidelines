This field goes hand in hand with the field **Additional biographical information (678)**. If additional biographical information about the person in question is found on a musical source, especially if this concerns information that is not readily found in other reference sources, the citation from the musical source is entered in the field **Additional biographical information (678)** and the siglum of the holding library is entered here. This field is linked to the **Institutions** authority file.
