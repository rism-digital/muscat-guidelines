**Use of English vs. other languages**  
English terminology or fixed English abbreviations are required in some fields while in other fields, other languages are acceptable.

When English is required, it is indicated in the guidelines for the applicable field.

**Cataloging language**  
When English is not required, you may use what the guidelines refer to as your **cataloging language**. RISM allows the following cataloging languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Alternately, other languages are allowed as long as a summary is provided in one of the six cataloging languages. The guidelines always state when the cataloging language may be used.

In the guidelines that follow, "cataloging language" refers to the practice of using either one of these six languages or a different language plus a translation into one of the six.

**Transliterations**  
National groups are responsible for determining what transliteration tables should be used when transliterating their language.
