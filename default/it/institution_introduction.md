# Institutions

La lista di voci di autorità per le istituzioni (enti, nomi collettivi) riporta nomi non di persona che appaiono in relazione a una fonte. This authority file contains both modern institutions (such as a library with a RISM library siglum) and historical corporate bodies (such as a publisher or an orchestra).

Institutions with RISM sigla are closely associated with RISM’s Series C, the [_Directory of Music Research Libraries_](https://rism.info/publications.html#series-c-directory-of-music-research-libraries){:blank}. The Directory is anchored in RISM’s objective to document the locations of musical sources worldwide. Series C provides descriptions of these holding institutions, whether libraries, archives, museums, churches, or private collections, as well as any institution with materials that support historical music research. Each institution in Series C has a RISM siglum, or an abbreviation, that makes it possible to concisely refer to the institution.

The information from Series C is published on the RISM website in the [Directory of RISM Library Sigla](https://rism.info/community/sigla.html){:blank}, in the [RISM Catalog](https://opac.rism.info/){:blank}, and in [RISM Online](https://rism.online/?mode=institutions){:blank}.

Thanks to cooperation with two IAML initiatives, the [Project Group on the Access to Music Archives](https://www.iaml.info/project-group-access-music-archives){:blank} and the [Project Group on RISM Series C](https://www.iaml.info/project-group-rism-series-c){:blank}, the descriptions of institutions in Muscat are compatable with the International Standard for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH) and models such as the Library Reference Model (LRM)/FRBR and Resource Description and Access (RDA).

National branches of IAML as well as RISM national groups can be involved in updating the institutions. This collaboration results in a powerful tool to locate music libraries, archives and documentation centers as well as their archival holdings.
