### Source type (593)

**Required field.**

The field **Source type** describes the nature of the material as well as its contents.

#### Source type (593 $a)

The **Source type** describes material characteristics. The options offered are based on the template chosen. Select from the following:

##### For handwritten materials

- **Autograph manuscript**: Written completely or mostly in the composer’s hand. If you have entered Anonymus as the composer and wish to select autograph manuscript here, add an explanation in the **General note (500)**.
- **Possible autograph manuscript**: Indicates a degree of uncertainty whether the manuscript is in the composer's hand.
- **Partial autograph**: Significant portions of the manuscript are in the composer's hand.
- **Manuscript copy**: The manuscript is in the hand of a person other than the composer. This is selected by default when a template for handwritten material has been chosen.
- **Manuscript copy with autograph annotations**: The manuscript is in the hand of a person other than the composer, but corrections or small additions are in the composer’s hand.
- **Additional printed material**: Printed material is present but will not be described in a separate record (see below).

##### For printed materials

- **Print**: This is selected by default when a template for printed material has been chosen.

In the holdings information, you can further select from the following:
- **Print**: This is selected by default.
- **Print with autograph annotations**: Handwritten annotations by the composer.
- **Print with non-autograph annotations**: Handwritten annotations not by the composer.
- **Additional manuscript material**: Manuscript material is present but will not be described in a separate record (see below).

##### For composite volumes

- **Composite**: This is selected by default.

For manuscript collections, select the source type that best represents the collection, or use multiple material groups to differentiate further.

##### Additional printed or manuscript material

Manuscript templates offer the option **Additional printed material.** In templates for printed items, the holdings information offers **Additional manuscript material**. This is to create a space in your record to briefly describe materials that accompany your main source but differ from the template type.

For example, you have a set of performing materials that comprises a handwritten set of parts and a printed score. You always have the option of describing the handwritten material in a template for manuscripts and the printed material in a template for prints, and including cross-references to the other records. While separate records for printed materials offer the fullest and most complete description, there might not always be enough information to describe a printed item fully or your preference might be to keep all your materials in one record. In such cases, you can indicate the additional materials and briefly describe them using these options.

If you are using a manuscript template, your first instance of the field **Source type** will match the template by default and pertain to the handwritten material. Add a second material group and select **Additional printed material**. Then describe your printed material as usual for this section.

If you are using a print template, in the holdings information select **Additional manuscript material**. Manuscript material can be described briefly in this section, or in the field **General note (500)**.

#### Content type (593 $b)

The **Content type** describes the form of the material. Select from the following:
- **Notated music**
- **Libretto**
- **Treatise**
- **Other**: Use sparingly to describe other kinds of materials that accompany the musical source.


For composite volumes that contain more than one content type, you may also select:

- **Mixed**

#### Special cases

##### Collections

You may choose the combination of source type and content type that best summarizes the collection as a whole, or multiple material groups may be added for each kind of source. Keep in mind that differentiated information will always be provided in the child record.

##### Composers, arrangers, and copyists

In the case of autograph manuscripts and possible autograph manuscripts, do not create an added entry **(700)** with the composer's name as the copyist. However, an exception is if the identity of the copyist is certain but it is uncertain if the copyist is also the composer. In such a case, enter the copyist's name in the field **Additional personal name (700)** but add the same name to the field **Composer/Author (100 $a)** with the appropriate **Attribution qualifier (100$j)**.

In some cases, such as with a partial autograph, an explanatory note in the field  **General note (500)** may be appropriate.

If the arranger of a composition was also the copyist, select **Manuscript copy** and not  **Autograph manuscript**.

##### Other forms of notation

Use **Notated music** as a **Content type** for documents that can be considered performance material, even if they do not use staff notation. This includes graphic notation, letter notation, number notation, and documents that only consist of performance instructions.

##### Photocopies

If your source is a mechanical reproduction (such as a photocopy) of a manuscript, follow these steps:

3\. Add an explanatory note in the field **General note (500)**.

2\. Select the type of reproduction in the field  **Special production technique (340 $d)**.

##### Typewritten or computer-generated material

If your source is typewritten or computer generated, follow these steps:

1\. Select a template for a handwritten item.

2\. Select **Autograph manuscript** if the composer or author created the document themselves. Select **Manuscript copy** if someone other than the composer or author created the document.

4\. Add an explanatory note in the field **General note (500)**.

1\. Add an explanatory note in the field **General note (500)**.
