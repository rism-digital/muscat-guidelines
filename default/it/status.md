### Record status

The **Record status** determines which records are published in the [RISM online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/index.php?id=4) and are thus publicly viewable. The status can be changed manually.

**Published**  
Records from Muscat with the status **Published** are sent for publication in the RISM catalog once a month, around the 19th of the month (depending on weekends and holidays). The records can then be seen in the catalog by the end of the month. All new records are automatically set to **Published**.



**Unpublished**  
Records with the status **Unpublished** are withheld from publication in the RISM online catalog. Some projects wish to keep this status until the project is complete, or individuals might want to wait until an item is fully cataloged before publishing it (such as with extensive records that have lots of incipits or individual entries).

Please use this status judiciously. It is not good practice to unpublish records that were once publicly available, nor is it ideal to keep records unpublished for a very long time.
