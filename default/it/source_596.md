### RISM series A/I and B reference (596)

The field **RISM series A/I and B reference** is for cross-references to printed editions in RISM, whether in the RISM database or in the printed A/I and B volumes. This field is most commonly used if the source clearly presents the same work, such as a manuscript copy of a printed edition. This field can also include cross-references to other printed editions, such as for references to other editions or cases where confusion with a different edition might arise.

Include a **General note (500)** to explain the connection between the source in hand and the source cited in the 596.

See also the field **Related source (787)**.

This field may not be used to indicate that a printed edition is absent from RISM's series A/I or a volume in the B series; use the field **Bibliographic reference (691)** instead.
