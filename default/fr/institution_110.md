#### **Siglum (110 $g)**

This field is for the unique, unalterable RISM library siglum. **Sigla are assigned by the RISM Editorial Center** in consultation with the RISM national working groups.

Library sigla are made up of three elements: a country abbreviation, a city abbreviation, and an institution abbreviation. In some cases, the institution abbreviation may be omitted (example: D-B). The abbreviations for the country and city are always capitalized and the abbreviation for the institution is always lowercase.  The country code is separated from the other details by a hyphen.  The code for the country is almost always taken from the list of international vehicle registration codes maintained by the United Nations. City and institution codes are created by the RISM Editorial Center.

 In case an institution has changed its name, it still keeps the same siglum. (For ex.: CZ-Bu)



_Examples_:  
GB-Cu = United Kingdom, Cambridge, University Library  
F-Pn = France, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Département de la Musique.

In the case of private collections, the last name of the owner is added to the city code in lowercase letters.

_Example_:  
I-PEbattisti = Italy, Perugia, Biblioteca privata Renzo Battisti.

RISM has been using library sigla since its foundation in 1952 in all of its publications and catalogs. They are also used in all of the standard international music encyclopedias and in musicological publications.
