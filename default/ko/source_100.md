### Composer/Author (100)

The field **Composer/Author** is for the identification of the main person involved as the author, in its broadest sense, of the source.

#### Name (100 $a)

**Required field.**

Enter the name of the person responsible for the work. This may be the composer (for music manuscripts and printed music), librettist (for librettos), or author of a work of music theory (for treatises).

This field is linked to the **Personal names** authority file through $0. Names not yet in the authority file may be added. In such cases, check the box "Confirm the insertion of a new value" and add the person's life dates, if known, in the field **Life dates (100 $d)**. The new name, including life dates, will be confirmed and edited by the Editorial Center.

If the source has multiple composers, select one to be entered in this field and the rest can be added in **Additional personal name (700)** using the function **Co-composer.**

If the source is anonymous but you can determine the composer, enter the composer's name and select the appropriate attribution qualifier. If you cannot determine the composer, enter the name **Anonymus** but omit an attribution qualifier. The name **Compilations** is entered for pasticcios or compilations.

#### Attribution qualifier (100 $j)

Select an indicator to describe the level of certainty of the attribution if any of these situations apply. If not, leave blank.

If you enter the composer as **Anonymus,** do not enter an attribution qualifier.

- **Alleged** means the name is present on the source, but the attribution is questionable or doubtful.
- **Ascertained** means the name is partially present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is (reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources, secondary literature, or other scholarly resources. This happens in most cases.
- **Conjectural** is a guess based on secondary evidence, such as secondary literature.
- **Misattributed** means the name is on the source but is incorrect. If the source is anonymous, leave this field blank.

**Obsolete procedures**: Older RISM cataloging guidelines allowed the attribution **Verified.** The attribution was used if the composer's name appears on the source in the same form as the RISM name heading. This practice was discontinued with the introduction of Muscat. **Doubtful** used to indicate that the authorship was in question; this was removed and the remaining terms were clarified in November 2021.
