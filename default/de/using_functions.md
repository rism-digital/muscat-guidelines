### Sections and actions in the editing mode

This refers to actions you can take when editing a source record.

The navigation column on the right allows you to jump to specific sections of the record and save and view your work.

Use the **links** at the top to jump to a section of the record. When editing a single section, your work will be retained if you jump to a different section or if you click on **Show all sections**. (But remember to save your work before leaving the editing mode!)

**Show all sections** lets you view all sections of the record. This is useful for when you want to return to editing the full record after working on a specific section.

**Show preview** lets you view the record without saving. To return to editing mode, click **Hide preview**.

**Validate** checks for errors in the record.

**Save and continue editing** allows you to save your work and continue in the editing mode. Save frequently to prevent you from losing your work. After a record is first saved, the RISM ID number is assigned automatically.

**Save and close** brings you back to the previous screen while saving your work.

**Cancel** brings you back to the previous screen without saving.

**Show modification history** allows you to view, restore, and delete previous versions of the record. Click **Show all sections** again to return to the editing mode and any unsaved changes.

**Attach a new image** lets you upload small images (usually watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings) to attach to your records. All images can be found in the **Authorities** menu under **Digital objects**.

### Buttons in the editing mode

**Magnifying glass**: Click here to search the authority file linked to the field. A separate window will open up. After you find what you need, click **Select** to make the transfer to your record.

**Trash can**: Delete a field by clicking on the trash can.

**Show/hide arrow**: Click on the arrow to expand or collapse fields.

**Add a group**: This button is found at the bottom of the section **Material description**. With different groups, you can associate different dates, formats, watermarks, names, institutions, etc. with different types of sources (or however you choose to describe your material). Some of these fields, such as **Additional personal name (700)**,**Additional institution (710)**, and **General note (500)**are also found elsewhere in the Sources template. Use your best judgment to decide where to place such information: does it apply to the entire source, or just this group of material?

### Other functions in the editing mode

#### Autocomplete

If you see a field that contains a key, the field is linked to the authority file or index. Begin typing and use the autocomplete to help you.

#### Adding new names, titles, subject headings, etc.

If you do not find what you need in the authority files, simply enter the name or term you need. Once you click to a different field, an orange border appears around the fields and you will see a checkbox that reads "Confirm the insertion of a new value." Click this box to confirm. For personal names, a field called **Life dates** will appear. Fill this out if you can because it helps the Editorial Center create a new authority record. When you save, the name or title will be automatically added to the authority files. See also **General Cataloging Guidelines** under **Personal names.**

News secondary literature must be entered directly in the **Secondary literature** database.

#### Required fields and validation

When you begin a new record, the most important fields will already be open and ready for you to fill in. Fields that are yellow are required fields. If you save without filling out one of these fields, a red border will appear around the fields that still need attention, and the sections in which the fields occur will be red in the sidebar on the right. In cases where no information can be filled out in a required field, the validation may be overridden by checking a box in the sidebar.

### Actions in the full record view

This refers to actions you can take when viewing the full record.

**Create:** This brings you to the template selection page from which you can create a new record.

**Return to the list:** This brings you back to the full list of all musical sources.

**Edit:** If you have permissions to edit the record, you will see this edit button.

**Duplicate**: In the full record view, a record may be copied by clicking on the Duplicate button.

### Merging records

Duplicate authority records can be merged by the Editorial Center. During the process of merging, any sources that are linked to the deprecated authority record are automatically transferred to the target record.

1. Pick out two records that you want to merge. One is the target, which will be kept. The other is deprecated and will be deleted.

2. In the editing mode of the deprecated record, set the Record Status to "Unpublished" at the bottom and save.

3. On the Institutions search page, perform a search so that the two records are on the same page of results.

4. Select the two you want to merge by clicking the checkbox to the left of the record.

5. Click "Merge" under Actions on the right.

6. A popup message will appear that says, "Should [the deprecated record] really be merged into [the target record]?" This is the action that takes links in the unpublished record and sends them to the target. Click OK.

7. Now a message appears that says, "Successfully merged Institution [deprecated record] into [target record]!"

8. You can confirm that this worked by viewing the unpublished, deprecated record, which will have 0 sources attached to it. The target record will have its previous records plus the new records attached to it from the merge. (It might take a moment for Muscat to reindex before this is displayed on the search page, but the full record views are correct.) Now you can delete the unpublished, deprecated record. Now you can delete the unpublished, deprecated record.

Note:
- In the Modification History for the linked sources, the change will be displayed like this: "Institution change id from 51000870 to 40009964"
- Only two records at a time can be merged.
- Only authority records can be merged, not Sources.
- As a protection against accidental deleting, autority records that are linked to other authority records cannot be deleted. Before merging, make sure that the target record has all of the information you need from the deprecated record. Delete any references to other authority records.
