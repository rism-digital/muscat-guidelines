Some fields, such as **Additional personal name (700)**, **Additional institution (710)**, and **General note (500)**, are also available elsewhere in the Sources template.

### Other functions in the editing mode

#### Autocomplete

Fields that contain a key are linked to an authority file or index. Begin typing and use the autocomplete to help you.

#### Adding new names, titles, subject headings, etc.

If you do not find what you need in the authority files, a new term can be added. Simply enter the name or term you need. Once you click to a different field, an orange border appears around the field and you will see a checkbox that reads "Confirm the insertion of a new value." Click this box to confirm. After you save the record, the new term will appear in the authority file. For personal names, a field called **Life dates** will appear. Fill this out if you can because it helps the Editorial Center complete the new authority record. See also **General cataloging guidelines** under **Personal names.**

New secondary literature must be entered directly in the **Secondary literature** database.

#### Required fields and validation

When you begin a new record, the most important fields will already be open and ready for you to fill in. Fields that are yellow are required fields. If you save without filling out one of these fields, a red border will appear around the fields that still need attention, and the sections in which the fields occur will be red in the right-hand navigation sidebar.

### Actions in the full record view

This section describes actions you can take when viewing the full record.

**Create:** Go to the template selection page from which you can create a new record.

**Return to the list:** This brings you back to the Sources page.

**Edit:** If you have permissions to edit the record, you will see an edit button.

**Duplicate**: Any record may be copied by clicking on the Duplicate button.

### Merging records

Duplicate authority records can be merged by the Editorial Center. During the process of merging, any sources that are linked to the deprecated authority record are automatically transferred to the target record.

1. Pick out two records that you want to merge. One is the target, which will be kept. The other is deprecated and will be deleted.

2. In the editing mode of the deprecated record, set the Record Status to "Unpublished" at the bottom and save.

3. On the search page of the authority file, perform a search so that the two records are on the same page of results.

4. Select the two you want to merge by clicking the checkbox to the left of the record.

5. Click "Merge" under Actions on the right.

6. A popup message will appear that says, "Should [the deprecated record] really be merged into [the target record]?" This is the action that takes links in the unpublished record and sends them to the target. Click OK.

7. Now a message appears that says, "Successfully merged \[Name of authority file\] \[deprecated record\] into [target record]!"

8. You can confirm that this worked by viewing the unpublished, deprecated record, which will have 0 sources attached to it. The target record will have its previous records plus the new records attached to it from the merge. (It might take a moment for Muscat to reindex before this is displayed on the search page, but the full record views are correct.) Now you can delete the unpublished, deprecated record. Now you can delete the unpublished, deprecated record.

Note:
- In the Modification History for the linked sources, the change will be displayed like this: "[Authority file] change id from 51000870 to 40009964"
- Only two records at a time can be merged.
- Only authority records can be merged, not Sources.
- As a protection against accidental deleting, authority records that are linked to other authority records cannot be deleted. Before merging, make sure that the target record has all of the information you need from the deprecated record. Delete any references to other authority records.
