### RISM Dokumentnummer (001)

Die RISM Dokumentnummer wird vom System vergegeben. Eine manuelle Eingabe ist nicht m√∂glich.

In record imports, nine-digit RISM ID numbers are assigned. The first three digits of a nine-digit number indicate the contributing national group.

**Obsolete procedures**: In former RISM cataloging programs, the RISM ID number was entered by hand. The RISM ID numbers varied in length from five to nine digits. Initial zeros may be ignored. The first three digits of a nine-digit number indicated the contributing national group. This practice was discontinued with the introduction of Muscat.
