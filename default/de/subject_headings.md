Die Normdatei der **Sschlagworte** enthält alle Gattungen und andere standardisierte Begriffe, die im Feld **Schlagwort (650)** verwendet werden. A record for a subject heading typically includes the standardized RISM term in English and in plural, translations or alternate terms, and a definition. Genres and forms found outside of Western Europe or common in a particular region where there is no English equivalent are given in the local language (and in the plural when it makes linguistic sense).

Subject headings can be added while cataloging. In the record, simply enter the new subject heading and click to a different field. You then get a message that says "Confirm the insertion of a new value" which you should then click.

After you save the record, go to the authority file for subject headings and find your new heading. You can edit subject headings you create. Please do the following:

**Begriff**: Enter the term in English and in the plural when possible. For regional music, particularly music found outside Western Europe, use the term common in the region. For languages that use non-Latin alphabets, enter the transliterated term here using the Latin alphabet.

**Synonym**: Please enter all alternate terms, each on a separate line (by pressing Enter). Here you can enter the term using other alphabet systems as well as synonyms, variations, other spellings, etc.

**Anmerkungen**: Please provide a short description in English, German, or French of what kind of term this is. Then feel free to also write in your native language, for the benefit of RISM contributors in your area, any description or guidelines you wish to set for the term: how to apply the term, any regional connections, references to secondary literature, etc.

Beispiel: **Gigues**. Begriffe sind auf Englisch, Französisch und Deutsch angegeben sowie andere Schreibweisen. Das Feld "Anmerkungen" erklärt die Vielfalt der existierenden Giguen und wann und wo sie aufgetreten sind. 

If you are working with music particular to a certain region, you can use whatever term is common in that region. A new term can be added if a similar genre is used in a different region but it is called something else.

You can also add the subject heading directly to the authority file (simply click **Create** in this authority file) and it will be immediately available for use.

Cataloging tips:

- 

Records for sources can include multiple subject headings, such as if there is a specific term as well as a more general or overarching term.

- 

To aid users in discovery, you are also free to include the local term in foreign languages and alphabets as an **Alternative title (730)** if you wish.
