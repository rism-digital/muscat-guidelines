The publication of the data records is controlled by the "work flow" commands. Every change of the "work flow" status must be confirmed by typing the word "yes".

### Unpublished

If a record (a catalogue record or an authority file) is saved, it is not yet published. This is indicated by the work flow status "unpublished".

### Published

The work flow status of records has to be changed to "published", so that the records can be viewed by the public.

### Deleted

Outdated or incorrect records can be hidden from the public. Logged-in cataloguers can however still see a deleted record.
