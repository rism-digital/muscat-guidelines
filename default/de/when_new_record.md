**When to input a new record (printed music)**

RISM treats each manuscript as a unique item and therefore each manuscript has its own RISM record. Printed materials are different, however, in that multiple copies of the same edition can be described using the same record (in which case you simply add your holdings information), but significant variants mean that a new record must be created.

The following offers guidelines as to which variants justify a new record and which do not. (This section draws heavily from [Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Music)](http://rbms.info/dcrm/)).

**A new record is required** if your item shows one or more of these differences when compared to the RISM record:

- **Different content** : Differences in the title or authors/contributors. Edition statement that indicates corrections, revisions, expansions, abridgments, or the inclusion of supplementary materials

- **Different publisher.**
-

**Different setting of the printing type** : Different plates (excluding replacement plates). Changes in the statement of extent. Change in bibliographical or musical format. Differences in music line-endings and catchwords (revealed by the comparison of multiple copies).

-

**Different publication status** : An original title page has been canceled and replaced. A new label is covering the original publication, distribution, production, etc., statement. Original sheets have been issued in a new publisher’s cover bearing more recent information than that provided on the title page. Series title page is new.

-

**Different plate and/or publisher numbers**.

**Do not create a new record** if your item has one of these differences. (If your item has _more than one_of these differences, you must decide if a new record is necessary.)

-

Different statement of printing: For example, "Fifth printing"

-

Different printer or other manufacturer but same publisher

-

Different printing date but same publication date

-

Different publisher’s cover that does not provide evidence of a discrete publishing unit (for example, a change of color in publisher’s cloth)

-

Different binding

-

Different publisher’s advertisements or catalogs (unless they are integral to the publication)

-

Corrections made in the course of a single press run (stop-press corrections)

-

Presence or absence of an errata slip



These guidelines mean that a single record will be used to represent multiple impressions, states, and binding variants relating to a single edition or issue. In your holdings information, you can enter details about variants and information specific to your copy.

#### Examples:

1. You are looking at RISM number 1001031016: Beethoven, "Adelaide," op. 46, no date, Bonn, N. Simrock, text in German and French.Spelling error on title page: "à une vois [!] Seule".

1.

Copy 1: Same publication information but spelling has been corrected. This alone would not warrant a new record, but there is an additional text language in Italian. **New record required** (different content/expansion). Result: 1001031017

2.

Copy 2: As copy 1, but a price has been engraved on the title page. **Do not create a new record** (no evidence of discrete publishing unit). Add your holdings and mention the price in the holdings information.

3.

Copy 3: As RISM number 1001031016 (but spelling has been corrected), but an additional publisher is named: "chez L. PLATTNER à ROTTERDAM." **New record required** (different publication status). Result: 1001031022



2. You are looking at RISM number 990055558 (A/I: R 2226): Romberg, Airs variés, op. 17, Offenbach, Jean André.

1. Copy 1: Same title but a label has been stuck over the publication information: "Imported by William Forster...Strand." You can see that the label is covering up the Offenbach/André information. **New record required** (different publication status/label covers original publication information). Result: 1001031194

3. You are looking at RISM 990024126 (RISM A/I: G 5286). The RISM record represents a set of multiple symphonies. Each symphony is available as a separate publication with separate plate numbers, issued as _livres_ 1, 2, and 3.

1. Option 1, the quick solution: If your library only has one of the items in the set, **add your holdings** and in the field "Material held" please note which symphony (livre) you have.
2. Option 2, a better solution, but takes more time: **Notify the Editorial Center** about this record and we will split the record into 3, one record for each symphony. Then, add your holdings to the record for the symphony you have.
