## Materialgruppen

The section **Material groups** explains the levels of detail possible in the section **Material description** in Muscat.

Various fields and subfields are repeatable throughout Muscat, but the entire section **Material description** itself is repeatable and is called a **Material group**. By default, each source record in Muscat has one material group and each field belonging to the material group is indicated in the MARC encoding through $8, starting with $801 for the first material group. When further groups are added, the group numbering in the MARC encoding is continued.

The **Material Description** section offers flexibility in terms of the level of detail that can be supplied. Descriptions can be given in general terms, or information regarding source types, dates, copyists, etc. can be clearly differentiated. Some fields found elsewhere in a source template are also available here to allow further differentiation between elements related to the source in general and a material group in particular.

As an example, 1 score and 10 parts can be described in different ways. The simplest way is to state one score in the field **Format, extent (300 $a)** and repeat the subfield to state the ten parts. Alternately, the field **Physical description (300)** can be repeated to enter different dimensions for the score and parts.

For catalogers going into a lot of detail, creating one material group for the score and one material group for the parts allows you to assign different dates, copyists, watermarks, and other information specific to just that score or just those parts. Parts can even be described in smaller groups if necessary. It is up to the cataloger's judgement to decide how to group material, whether based on source type, date, format, or other criteria.
