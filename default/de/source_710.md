### Additional institution (710)

This field appears twice for sources. It appears in the section **People and institutions** to list all additional institutions, organizations, or other corporate bodies involved with the source. It is also in the section **Material description** if you wish to associate additional institutions with particular materials groups, especially when creating multiple material groups.

Publishers named after people but acting out the function of publisher (Pleyel, Andr√©, etc.) are entered here. In the case of self-published music, enter the name of the person in its natural form, such as Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf.

#### Institution (710 $a)

Enter the names of all institutions that appear on or are associated with the source. This field is linked to the ** Institutions** authority file. Names not yet in the authority file may be added.

#### Department (710 $b)

Enter, if necessary, the name of the unit of an institution, such as a department. Enter in the local language.

#### Attribution (710 $j)

Select an indicator to describe the level of certainty of the attribution if any of these situations apply. If not, leave blank.

- **Alleged** means the name is present on the source, but the attribution is questionable or doubtful.
- **Ascertained** means the name is partially present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is ( reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources, secondary literature, or other scholarly resources. This happens in most cases.
- **Conjectural** is a guess based on secondary evidence, such as secondary literature.
- **Doubtful** means attribution is in question.
- **Misattributed** means the name is on the source but is incorrect.
