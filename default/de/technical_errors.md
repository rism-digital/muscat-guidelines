# Technische Probleme

**1. I can't save my work**  
Make sure you are using either Firefox or Chrome. Internet Explorer will not let you save anything!

**2. The fields stretch all the way across a page and cut into other text**  
This might be a screen resolution issue. Muscat works best on screens that are at least 1366 x 768 pixels. Other resolutions might lead to display issues.

**3. I can't scroll down the screen**  
This also might be a screen resolution issue. See #2.

**4. My screen is gray and all I see is an hourglass.**  
This happens when you are searching in the indexes. Check to see if another window is open. From that window, navigate back to the main screen.

**5. My incipit seems to have stalled.**  
Try clicking the "refresh" arrows, or save your record and try entering the incipit again.
