In A/I, it was frequently the case that multiple editions of a single piece could be identified. These editions were listed together within the composer's entry. Instead of listing full titles for each edition (titles which were frequently the same or similar), a space-saving shortcut was employed in which a full title was given for the edition at the start of the list, and a dash (-) was given to the subsequent editions for the rest of the list. An entry that started with a dash therefore meant that the full title should be inferred from the edition given in full at the start of the list.

In Muscat, the entry with the full title is called the "initial entry" and the entries that had dashes in A/I are called "following entries." The arrangement in A/I is recreated by linking from the following entries to the initial entry. This linking is necessary because the following entries, in many cases, still lack full title information.

It should be noted that the listing in A/I, and therefore the linking in Muscat, did not and does not correspond to any hierarchy in a sense of first editions and reprints. Though chronological order was attempted when feasible, it was hardly consistent or indeed possible to determine.
