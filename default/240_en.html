</p><h3>Standardized title (240)<br></h3><p>The title is entered here in a standardized
form, which brings together under the same title compositions which, despite
having a variety of names, are the same or similar. Also called the "filing
title" or "uniform title." </p>&nbsp;<br><p></p>

<h4>Standardized title
(240 $a) </h4>

<p>

</p><p><b>Required
field.<br></b></p>

<p></p><p><span>Indicate questionable information
with a question mark at the end (for example, <b>Die Zauberflöte?</b>). Do not use brackets or parentheses. Put
alternative versions of the title in the field <b>Additional title (730)</b>. </span></p>

<p>A
standardized title can be generated from the following, in order of preference: </p>

<ol><li>Distinctive titles </li><li>Text incipits </li><li>Genres</li><li>Tempo markings </li></ol>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol><li><b>Distinctive titles</b><span><br>Distinctive titles include all kinds
     of stage works, oratorios, cantatas, and songs, and also certain kinds of
     instrumental music (such as character pieces from the 18th
     century with a distinctive, individual title).<br>
     <br>
     Enter the distinctive title in standard spelling as in (1) New Grove, (2)
     MGG, (3) catalogs of works, and/or (4) other reference books. Do not omit
     initial articles (the, a, an, der, die, le, l', etc.).<br>
     <br>
     Popular names or nicknames (such as "Eroica" or "Nelson
     Mass") do not count as standardized titles. Such names are entered in
     the field <b>Additional titles (730
     $a)</b>. <br>
     <br>
     <i>Examples:<br>
     </i>Die Forelle<br>
     Die Zauberflöte<br>
     The beggar's opera<br><br>
     <br>
     </span></li><li><b>Text incipit</b><span><br>
     Enter the text incipit as the standardized title for vocal pieces if there
     is no distinctive title. <br>
     <br>
     If a source consists of a recitative and aria or a scena and aria, the
     text incipit of the aria is always used as the standardized title. Apply
     the same principles to a recitative and cavatina, scena and rondo, or
     similar combinations. If you have a single opera aria from an opera whose
     title is unknown, enter the text incipit of the aria.<br>
     <br>
     With cantatas, on the other hand, the text of the first vocal piece
     functions as the standardized title, regardless of whether it is a
     recitative, aria, or chorus. <br>
     <br>
     However, use the genre for masses, requiems, obsequies, litanies, and
     compositions for the divine office. The same is true for complete operas
     and oratorios whose titles are unknown.<br>
     <br>
     When entering text incipits, use the orthographic rules of each respective
     language to dictate use of upper or lower case letters. Capitalize the
     names of the deity (God, Herr, Dio, Dieu, Signore, Lord, etc.). Omit
     punctuation marks and repetitions within the incipit. If the
     item is clearly a translation, enter the standardized title in the
     original language. <br>
     <br>
     Make sure that the text incipit in this field is identical with the text
     incipit in the field <b>Text incipit
     (031 $t)</b>. With Latin texts, use the text
that precedes the comma (from the list in the appendix) as a standardized title but use the text incipit in its
entirety for the text incipit.
     <br><br>
     <i>Examples:<br>
     </i>Der Mond ist aufgegangen<br>
     Gloria [with text incipit:&nbsp;</span><span>Gloria, in excelsis Deo et in terra pax]<br><br>
     
     </span></li><li><b>Genre</b><span><br>
     Use the genre of the piece as the standardized title if you have neither a
     distinctive title nor a text incipit. In most cases, enter the genre in
     English and in the plural (such as <b>Operas</b>). </span><span><span>Note that for some genres,
a corresponding <b>Subject heading (650)</b> is
used. Please consult the appendix <b>Standardized title – Subject heading</b><span> in the <b>Guidelines</b></span> for assistance. <br>
<br>
</span>
     <i>Examples:<br>
     </i>Symphonies<br>
     Allemandes<br>
     <br>
     </span></li><li><b><span>Tempo indications<br>
     </span></b><span>Enter the
     tempo indication if the genre cannot be determined. If none of these
     options are available, use the following terms:<br>
     -Songs (vocal pieces)<br>
     -Pieces (a generic piece)<br>
     -Movements (a single movement of an instrumental piece without a tempo
     indication and of indeterminate character)<br>
     <br>
     <i>Examples:<br>
     </i>Presto<br>
     Lento</span></li></ol>

optional and may be added in the field <b>Additional

<p><br></p><h4>Arrangement statement
(240 $o) </h4>

<p>Select <b>Arrangement</b><span> if the work is an

&nbsp;<br>
Note that retextings and transpositions are not considered arrangements. In
such cases, enter the name of the responsible person, if known, under </span><b>Additional personal name (700)</b>. Although the works are not considered arrangements, the person is
referred to there as "Arranger". </p>

Arrangements should also be
distinguished from independent works (free elaborations), such as variations,
paraphrases, parodies, and fantasies on themes from the original work.<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Subheading (240 $k) </h4>

<p>This field is for special form aspects as applicable. Select
from the following:</p><ul><li><b>Excerpts</b>: if only one or several sections of the complete

field </b><b>except for the following: operas and oratorios with the standard instrumentation V (X), Coro, orch<br>If you have sketches or collections, enter a scoring summary if it makes sense to do so.&nbsp;<br></b></p>

<p></p><p><span>Enter a
brief scoring (instrumentation) summary of the overall medium of performance
for the work here. Separate each element of the scoring summary with commas.
Enter a maximum of four elements. A detailed description of the instrumentation
is entered in the field <b>Total scoring (594)</b>. The entire scoring summary
goes in one line; repeat the field only to indicate alternative instrumentations (see
below). </span></p>

<p>Use terms from the <b><a target="_blank">Abbreviations</a> </b>list.
Write out any terms that are not contained in this list in full and in English.
</p>

<p>Enter
groups of instruments in the following order:<br></p><br><ul><li>

than one of the same voice or instrument is indicated, place the number in
parentheses after the part designation, such as <b>B (2)</b>. Use <b>V</b> to indicate
an unknown vocal part and <b>i</b> for an
unknown instrument. Also use <b>V</b> to group
together several different vocal parts, such as <b>V (8)</b>. Indicate an unknown number with <b>(X)</b>. </span></p>



<p>Specify
solo instruments only if they have a continuous solo function in relation to an
orchestra, especially in a solo concerto. Do not list a part here if it only
has occasional solo passages, such as an oboe solo in a section of a cantata.</p>



<p>In the case
of arrangements, the scoring summary refers to the personnel required in the
present source, not in the work on which an arrangement is based. <span><span>If the instrumentation of the
original work is known, specify it in the field <b>General note (500)</b>.</span> In the
case of a <b>Collection</b>, only use the field if the particular scoring is
applicable to all the works contained in the collection. <br></span></p><p>

</p><p>This field
may be repeated in cases where alternative instrumentation is suggested, such
as a song that is for either soprano or tenor. In such cases, enter each
possible instrumentation in a separate field<span>: for example, <b>S, pf</b> on one line and <b>T, pf</b> on the next.</span></p><p></p><p>

</p><p><span>If you have
a figured bass, enter the instrument as usual, such as <b>b</b>, <b>bc</b>, <b>org</b>, etc. (but see the tables in the
section <b>Figured bass in scores and/or parts</b> for guidance with related fields).</span></p>

scoring summary if the performing forces are unknown or uncertain.
