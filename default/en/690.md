#### Catalog of works (690 $a) 

Enter the short title for the thematic catalog or catalog of works (for example, **BWV** ). This field is linked to the **Secondary literature** database. Catalogs not in the database can be entered there.

#### Number/page (690 $n) 

**Required field if "Catalog of works" is filled out.**

Enter the catalog number from a works or thematic catalog, or the page number of the piece in that catalog. The RISM Editorial Center determines the appropriate citation style, in keeping with the style of the catalog. The citation style is explained in the corresponding entry in the **Secondary literature** database. If the source contains only one movement of a work, indicate the number of the movement after a slash. Write **deest** if a particular composition is not listed in the composerâ€™s catalog of works.
