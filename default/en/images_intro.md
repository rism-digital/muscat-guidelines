The **Digital objects** database contains all images and MEI files that have been uploaded to Muscat. The database is intended to store and display individual images that serve to illustrate a point in a record, such as a watermark, a binding, or a handwriting sample; it is also where MEI incipits are attached. You can link digital objects to source records as well as authority records. Full digital versions of sources should not be uploaded here but rather linked in the field **External resource (856)**.

Add an image (.jpeg or .png) by clicking on **Attach a new image** when you are editing a source. Always add a short description, such as a description of the watermark, the location on the source, or the siglum. This will help you find them later. Images are displayed in the order they are linked to the record. 

Please consult the RISM Editorial Center if you wish to add an MEI incipit.

- **Link institution** : Allows you to link the image to the authority file of an institution, such as an image of the building
