### Initial entry (775 $w)

Do not edit this field.

This field links to the RISM ID number of the initial entry. The phrases "Initial entry" and "Following entries"
correspond to the suborder adopted in the printed volumes of series A/I, in which identical contents were indicated by a
dash beneath the first printed edition mentioned. Most of these had a complete title. This system did not correspond to
any hierarchy in a sense of first editions and reprints. However, linking is necessary in that similarities in content
of the titles have to be reflected. Furthermore, since the subsequent entries often lack short and/or original titles,
there needs to be a clear reference to the (original) title of the first entry.
