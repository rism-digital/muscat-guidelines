#### Provenance (852 $z)

This field can be used to indicate the name of a special collection, such as a collection, bequest, gift, papers, archive, _Nachlass_, or similar, that the source belongs to.

Note: Enter ownership marks in the field **Provenance note (561)**.

#### Material held (852 $q)

This field is available in the holdings information for printed music. If your copy is incomplete, enter the parts (using RISM abbreviations) or volumes you have. If you know your copy is complete, it is helpful if you write **complete** in this field. Use English terminology. Here, completeness refers to the presence of all expected parts or volumes; other degrees of incompleteness (such as missing pages) can be indicated in a note.

Missing parts should be entered in the field **General note (500)**.

##### Examples  

- vl only  
- Coro S, A, B only  
- vol. 1, 3 only  
- complete

#### Shelfmark (852 $c)

**Required field.**

Enter the shelfmark (also called "call number") in this field. Transcribe as precisely as possible, including spacing and punctuation, but enter shelfmarks as a single line of text without line breaks. Enter shelfmarks consistently within any given library collection. Indicate superscript characters with \| (the vertical pipe). If no shelfmark is present, enter the English phase **[without shelfmark]** in square brackets. The English phrase **[no indication]** can be used if the presence of a shelfmark is unknown. Enter additional shelfmarks in the field **Other shelfmarks (591)**.  

In records for printed music, the phase **[no indication]** has been automatically added by the Editorial Center in cases where a shelfmark is not available. National groups revising their holdings should change **[no indication]** to the current shelfmark.

- Ms Mus 165/6  
- Mus.ms. 743  
- Th.mus.A 5  
- P 7 G 359
