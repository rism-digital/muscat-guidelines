#### **Additional biographical information (678 $a)**

This field goes hand in hand with the field **Associated institution (510 $a)**. If additional biographical information about the person in question is found on a musical source, especially if this concerns information that is not readily found in other reference sources, the citation from the musical source is entered in this field and the siglum of the holding library is entered in the field **Associated institution (510 $a)**.

Information you might want to enter here includes name variations, positions held, indications of when the person was active, or other notable information. Sometimes, the musical source you hold is the only source for such information! When possible, make sure you additionally enter this information in standardized form in the appropriate fields.
