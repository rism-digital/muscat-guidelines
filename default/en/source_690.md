### Catalog of works (690)

The field **Catalog of works** is used to refer to the number used in a thematic catalog or catalog of works to identify a work.  

If you wish to cite information found in a catalog of works other than the catalog number, use the field **Bibliographic reference (691).** 

#### Catalog of works (690 $a)

Enter the short title for the thematic catalog or catalog of works (for example, **BWV**). This field is linked to
the **Secondary literature** database.  


#### Number/page (690 $n)

**Required field if "Catalog of works" is filled out.**

Enter the catalog number from a works or thematic catalog, or the page number of the piece in that catalog. The RISM
Editorial Center determines the appropriate citation style, in keeping with the style of the catalog. The citation style
is explained in the corresponding entry in the **Secondary literature** database through $0. If the source contains only one
movement of a work, indicate the number of the movement after a slash. Write **deest** if a particular composition is
not listed in the composer’s catalog of works.
