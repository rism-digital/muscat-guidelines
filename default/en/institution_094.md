### Siglum (094)

This field is for the unique, unalterable RISM library siglum. **Sigla are assigned by the RISM Editorial Center** in
consultation with the RISM national working groups.

Previously the siglum for an institution was stored in the 110 $g field. This was changed to a dedicated field in 2024 to
allow former sigla to be tracked within the same field.

#### Siglum (094 $a)

Library sigla are made up of three elements: a country abbreviation, a city abbreviation, and an institution
abbreviation. In some cases, the institution abbreviation may be omitted (example: D-B). The abbreviations for the
country and city are always capitalized and the abbreviation for the institution is always lowercase. The country code
is separated from the other details by a hyphen. The code for the country is taken from the list of international vehicle registration
codes maintained by the United Nations. City and institution codes are assigned by the RISM Editorial Center.

If an institution has changed its name it keeps the same siglum. (For example: CZ-Bu)

In general, if a library collection is moved to a new host institution the sources are not assigned a new institution, and thus the siglum of
the now-subsumed library will remain. An entry is added to the institution record under the 580 "Now in" field pointing to the institution record
of the new host. This is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

##### Examples

- GB-Cu = United Kingdom, Cambridge, University Library
- F-Pn = France, Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Département de la Musique

In the case of private collections, the last name of the owner is added to the city code in lowercase letters. Double last names are written together, without a space.

##### Example

- I-PEbattisti = Italy, Perugia, Biblioteca privata Renzo Battisti.

RISM has been using library sigla since its foundation in 1952 in all of its publications and catalogs. They are also
used in all of the standard international music encyclopedias and in musicological publications.

#### Former sigla (094 $z)

Occasionally, due to geopolitical events or the need for clarification, an institution will be assigned a new siglum. To facilitate cross-references
with the former siglum, the old sigla are added to this field. **Sigla are only reassigned by the RISM Editorial Center**.

##### Examples

- I-RVat = The former siglum for the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, now V-CVbav.
- J-Tn = The former siglum for Nanki Ongaku Bunko, now J-WAn.
