### Internal note (599 $a)

Enter local notes for internal use. They are not published in the OPAC. Local notes can be used for comments of all
kinds, such as questions, comments, or research to be done. Delete notes after they have served their purpose. It is
best practice to sign your note using your initials and the date.

If an item is held by the Editorial Center in Frankfurt, add the note: **RISM-HB** for items in the reference library
or **RISM-HB (PDF)** for items on the shared drive. (Likewise, if you see this note in an item you need, please feel
free to contact the Editorial Center staff and we are happy to look something up for you or make you a copy.)
