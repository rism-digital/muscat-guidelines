### Physical description (300)

**Required field.**  
This field is for the number of items, the format, and (for all formats except parts) the extent.

Note that the entire section **Material description** is repeatable, as is the field **Physical description (300)** and
the subfield **Format, extent (300 $a)**. This means that you are free to create one **Material description** section
per format, or you can list each format on a separate line in **Physical description (300)**.

Let's say you have 1 score and 10 parts. For catalogers going into a lot of detail, creating one **Material
description** section for the score and one **Material description** section for the parts allows you to assign
different dates, copyists, watermarks, and other information specific to just that score or just those parts (or you can
even describe the parts in smaller groups if necessary). If the date, copyist, etc. are the same for both the score and
the parts, or if you are not going into so much detail, then it is enough to simply list one underneath the other in the
field **Format, extent (300 $a)**. Different dimensions can be entered if you repeat the field **Physical description (
300)**.

#### Format, extent (300 $a)

The field **Format, extent (300 $a)** is built up of three components: **Items, Format, Extent.** Note that an extent is
not given for parts, including tablature parts; the extent of parts is entered in the field **Parts held (590)**. Use
the English terminology listed.

**Items**: State the number of items held. Use **X** to indicate an unknown number of items.

**Format**: Use one of the following.  
General:

- **part(s)**: The notation of a work for an instrument or voice regardless of the number of staves per system (includes
  piano, organ, piano four-hands). Use also for partbooks.
- **score(s)**: Contains all the instruments and/or voices of a composition, as long as more than one performing force
  is involved. This includes works for voice and accompaniment.

Kinds of scores:

- **vocal score(s)**: Vocal part(s) with the accompaniment arranged for a keyboard instrument.
- **keyboard score(s)**: The instruments are arranged for a keyboard instrument (no vocal parts). Indicate the extent
  immediately following regardless of the number of staves per system.
- **chorus score(s)**: A score that contains only the music for the voices.
- **particella(s)**: A sketch or draft of a composition in a short score format.
- **short score(s)**: All other kinds of reduced, condensed, or short scores.

Special formats:

- **tablature part(s)**: The type of tablature, if known, should be named in the field **General note (500).**
- **tablature score(s)**
- **choirbook(s)**: A book in which all voices of a work are written separately so that the choir can read the music
  from one book.
- **sketch(es)**: Use for sketches if the type of format cannot be more precisely determined.
- **text document(s)**: Use for libretti, treatises, and other kinds of text documents. A note in **General note (500)**
  may be necessary.
- **prompt book(s)**: A document (can be a short score or text) used by a prompter for a stage work.
- **table book(s)**: parts arranged on a page so that all performers can read from it while seated around a table.

Other:

- **various**: Use for collection parent records if the collection contains different kinds of formats (such as a full
  score and a keyboard score).
- **other**: Use if none of the above apply. In such cases, explain with a note in the field **General note (500)**.
  The number of items or the extent is not required.

For conductor part(s), use **part** or **parts** here and enter **conductor part** in the field **Parts held (590).**

**Extent**: Enter the number of pages, leaves, or gatherings. Choose among the following abbreviations: **f** for
folio, **p** for page, **lvs** for leaves (sheets), and **fds** for folds (gatherings). In this system, one **lvs**
corresponds to two **f**, whereas one **fds** means at least one **lvs**.

You may also indicate single pages or folios within a manuscript collection. Use only one method of enumeration.
Indicate other units (such as the conversion from folios to pages) in the field**General note (500)**. When indicating
recto and verso, use both **r** and **v**.

Do not indicate the extent for parts here. Extent is entered in the field **Parts held (590)**.

_Examples_:

- 1 score: 35 p.
- 1 score (2x): 2, 2 f.
- 1 short score: 8 f.
- 1 tablature score: p. 5-8
- 1 keyboard score: f. 2r-4v
- various: 101 p.
- 5 parts
- 1 part
- other: 10 p.
- other

Examples of other foliations:  
Foreword is numbered I-VIII, followed by 25 pages of music

- VIII, 25 p.

1 folio is numbered, foreword is numbered I-VIII, followed by 25 pages of music

- 1 f., VIII, 25 p.

1 folio is unnumbered, foreword is numbered I-VIII, followed by 25 pages of music

- [1] f., VIII, 25 p.

Pages change from roman to arabic numerals

- XII p., p. 13-36

Blank pages or foliation irregularities can be mentioned in the field**General note (500)**.

- f. [1] blank
- f. [2] blank
- p. 272 occurs twice

#### Other physical details (300 $b)

The presence of illustrations and other supplemental elements can be mentioned here. Enter using your cataloging
language.

Examples include:

- advertisements
- engraved title page
- frontispiece
- illustrations
- list of subscribers
- list of subscribers through praenumeration (common in Germany)
- portraits
- printer's device
- printer's mark
- vignette

#### Dimensions (300 $c)

Enter the dimensions of the source: height x width in cm. Fractions of centimeters may be indicated by either a comma or
period. A second set of dimensions can be given in parentheses. If there are more than two different sets of dimensions,
enter the English phrase **Different sizes** ; further elaboration can be made in the field **General note (500)**.
Formats such as **octavo**, **quarto**, etc. should be indicated in the field **Book format (340 $m)**.

_Examples_:

- 25.5 x 30.5 cm
- 36 x 25.5 cm
- 25.5 (21.5) x 32 (28.5) cm
- Different sizes

For printed items, if desired you may enter the dimensions of the printed area. Use indications such as "printed area"
or "plate mark." Separate this measurement from the measurement of the source with a semicolon. If dimensions vary,
measure the title page and the first page of music (including, when applicable, an indication of what was measured).

_Examples_:

- 20 x 16 cm; plate mark 18 x 15,5 cm
- Plate mark, title page: 20.2 x 27.7 cm; plate mark, music: 20.4 x 28.2 cm
- Printed area, title page: 20.2 x 27.7 cm; printed area, music: 20.4 x 28.2 cm
