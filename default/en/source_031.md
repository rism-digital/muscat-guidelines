### Incipit (031)

Incipits help identify works and facilitate the comparison of sources. Best practice for instrumental music is to
include incipits from a high part and a low part, such as vl 1 and bass. For vocal music, include incipits from the
highest voice and the first violin or the highest instrumental part. Notate transposing instruments at sounding pitch.

If the notation you need is not available using the Plaine & Easie code, transcribe the music the best you can and
include an explanatory note. You can attach an image of the incipit from the source for further clarification.

For assistance with transcribing mensural notation, please see "Basic Mensural Notation Reference" by Ted
Dumitrescu ([http://cmme.org/misc/refsheet.pdf](http://cmme.org/misc/refsheet.pdf))).

#### Work number, movement number, incipit number (031 $a, b, c)

**Required field if any field in this section is used.**

The incipit number consists of three digits, which stand for work, movement and incipit. The first digit is always a 1.
Movements refer to significant sections of a work, whether they are technically movements (such as a symphony) or
different sections (such as an aria). To indicate that incipits sound simultaneously (for example, a vl 1 and bass), the
first and the second incipit numbers must be the same.

Number incipits consecutively even if movements are missing in the source. For example, if the source is a
three-movement symphony but the middle movement is missing, the incipits will be numbered 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 (not 1.3.1). (
Note: Periods between the numbers are automatically added by Muscat.)

_Examples_:

- 1.1.1 = 1st work, 1st movement, 1st incipit
- 1.1.2 = 1st work, 1st movement, 2nd incipit (sounds at the same time as 1.1.1)
- 1.1.2 = 1st work, 1st movement, the entrance of the vocal part
- 1.2.1 = 1st work, 2nd movement, 1st incipit

#### Title of movement, tempo (031 $d)

Enter the title of the movement and tempo or similar indications, if specified, as it appears on the source. Use **|** (
the vertical pipe) with a single space before and after the sign to show a line break. Use square brackets to indicate
supplements to the original; any such additions should be spelled consistently. Multiple titles or additional tempo
markings can be added in separate fields. If you are entering multiple incipits for which the title or tempo indication
is the same, enter it only for the first music incipit.

#### Voice/instrument (031 $m)

Enter the voice part or instrument using the list of **RISM instrument abbreviations**. Enter **V** for an unknown vocal
part. Enter **i** for an unknown instrumental part. Notate transposing instruments at sounding pitch. Indicate the
tuning of an instrument in the **General note** field.

_Examples_:

- pf
- T coro
- org with text

#### Role (031 $e)

Enter the standardized dramatic role name here. If you fill out this field, make sure to also fill out the field **
Dramatic role named (595)**. Indicate any editorial additions with square brackets. Indicate any questionable
information with a question mark.

#### Text Incipit (031 $t)

A text incipit consists of the first few words of the piece or section and can be the first line, first phrase, or other
group of words that make linguistic sense. Text incipits serve to identify the text used and do not necessarily need to
match the length of music given in the music incipit. Text incipits can be included regardless of whether a music
incipit is entered. Please note that separate rules apply to texts in Latin (see below).

Text incipits are given in standardized form. Enter the text incipit using modern spelling. Refer to the index **
Title/text incipits** to help standardize your entry. Enter new incipits if they are not in the index.

Do not put portions of the text in square brackets or supply missing words. Omit punctuation marks and repetitions in the text.
Accents should be used only as they appear in the dictionary or if they are grammatically correct. Write out numbers at
the beginnings of texts as words. Upper and lower case letters follow the rules of the respective language, except that
designations for God (Herr, Dio, Dieu, Signore, Lord, etc.) always start with a capital letter. If the text incipit is
used as the standardized title (240), make sure that the length and spelling agree exactly.

Omit the text entirely if you cannot read it and add a note saying "Text illegible" or similar.

In Romance languages, continue the text directly after an apostrophe and without a space. An exception to this rule is
when the first letter of a word is replaced by an apostrophe (for example: Fra l'amante e 'l genitor).

Ascertained or derived texts that do not appear on the source can be given here. In such cases, put the entire text in
square brackets. Among these are:

- Texts if a vocal part is missing
- Text incipits in the original language of the work when the source contains a translated version
- Texts of vocal compositions which became the theme of a variation or the basis of an instrumental arrangement

**Non-Latin scripts:** If your source has a text incipit that uses non-Latin letters or characters (
Cyrillic/Greek/Hebrew/Korean etc. alphabet, Chinese characters, etc.) enter the **Text incipit** using the original
script. Translations or transliterations are optional and may be added in additional text incipit fields. Add
translations not on the source in square brackets. You may translate into any of the RISM languages.

**Special rules for texts in Latin:** Enter Latin texts, both sacred and secular. The field is linked to the file **
Title/text incipits**. Within the file **Title/text incipits**, a term preceded by the indicator **t** means that you
can get information about the exact liturgical context, variant versions, and other matters. If the text incipit is used
as the standardized title, make sure that the spelling is identical, but remember that Latin text in standardized titles
is only entered up to the comma. Use square brackets to enter Latin texts which are not named on the source but have
been determined by research.

Standard Latin texts usually match the texts in the _Liber usualis_. In RISM, these texts usually contain a comma. For
example, when you search for the text "Et in terra pax", you will see about a dozen options, but only 1 has a comma and
this source is used 4,800 times in the database. Therefore it is the one we want â€“ presuming this matches your source.
If your text incipit is only "Et in terra pax" then this means your source (1) contains only these words or (2)
continues in a way that is different form the _Liber usualis_. This is of course possible, but in most cases you want
the version with the comma.

#### Key or mode (031 $r)

Select the key or mode from the list.

#### Key signature (031 $n)

Enter **x** for sharp keys or **b** for flat keys, followed by capital letters of the pitches to be raised or lowered.
If a piece is clearly in a certain key but a sharp or flat is not in the key signature, the missing sharps or flats may
be added in square brackets. If there is no key signature, leave the field blank.

_Examples:_

- xF = F is sharp = G major or E minor
- bBE = B and E are flat = B-flat major or G minor
- xFC[G] = F and C are sharp in the source but the piece is clearly in A major, so the last sharp is added in square brackets

#### Time signature (031 $o)

Enter time signatures as fractions. The following are also allowed:

**c** = common time or tempus imperfectum cum prolatione imperfecta  
**c/** = cut time, alla breve  
**3** = proportio tripla; also **1**, **2**, etc.  
**c3** = proportio tripla  
**c3/2  
c.** = tempus imperfectum cum prolatione perfecta  
**o** = tempus perfectum cum prolatione imperfecta  
**o/** = tempus perfectum cum prolatione minore diminutum  
**o.**  = perfect time, tempus perfectum cum prolatione perfecta

If the meter changes constantly, you can write the first time signature followed by the second, separated by a space. If
the incipit is without a time signature, leave this field blank.

_Examples_:

- 4/4
- 6/8
- 3/4 4/4

If the time signature in the source is obviously wrong, please correct it to match the incipit given. Include an
explanatory note in the field **General note**.

#### Clef (031 $g)

Select a clef from the list. The letter indicates the kind of clef. A hyphen means modern notation. A plus sign means
mensural notation. The number refers to position on the staff line.

#### Validity (031 $s)

Do not enter anything into this field! (It is only used for old data.)

#### Music incipit (031 $p)

Enter the music incipit in encoded form using the Plaine & Easie code (see
also [https://www.iaml.info/plaine-easie-code](https://www.iaml.info/plaine-easie-code)). The incipit should be at least
two bars (measures) or six notes long.

**1. Octaves**  
' = in the 1st octave above middle C  
'' = in the 2nd octave above middle C  
''' = in the 3rd octave above middle C  
, = in the 1st octave below middle C  
,, = in the 2nd octave below middle C  
,,, = in the 3rd octave below middle C

**2. Rhythmic values**  
0 = longa  
9 = breve  
1 = whole note / semibreve  
2 = half note / minim  
4 = quarter note / crotchet / semiminim  
8 = eighth note / quaver / fusa  
6 = 16th note / semiquaver / semi fusa   
3 = 32nd note / demisemiquaver  
5 = 64th note / hemidemisemiquaver  
7 = 128th note / semihemidemisemiquaver

7. = neumatic notation

Periods are used for dotted notes. Multiple periods can be added to a note.

4. = dotted quarter note / dotted crotchet   
   8.. = double dotted eighth note / double dotted quaver

**3. Accidentals**  
x = sharp  
xx = double sharp  
b = flat  
bb = double flat  
n = natural

**4. Note names**  
C, D, E, F, G, A, B

**5. Grace notes and ornaments**  
g = acciaccatura (without rhythmic value, precedes the note name)  
q = appoggiatura (with rhythmic value, precedes the note name)  
qq...r = several appoggiaturas or ornaments which belong together (with rhythmic value)

**6. Rests**

The '-' (minus sign) is for a single-note rest. Use '=' (equal sign) for a measure rest. For multiple measures of rest,
follow the = with the number of measures. A bar line must be added for it to display.

_Example for an eighth-note rest:_

- 8-

_Examples for one measure of rest:_

- =
- =1

_Examples for multiple measures of rest:_

- =35

**7. Bar/measure lines**  
/ = bar line  
// = double bar line  
//: = double bar line with repeat  
:// = double bar line with repeat  
://: = double bar line with repeat

**8. Other symbols**  
t = trill (immediately follows the note)

+ = tie (immediately follows the note; not to be confused with a slur)   
  () = fermata/hold/pause (only a single note letter name or a single rest can be bracketed; accidentals, pitch
  indications, etc. must be outside the parentheses; see also **10. Special rhythms**, below)

Do not enter slurs.

**9. Beaming**  
{ = beginning of beaming  
} = end of beaming

Example:  
{qq6'CDEDr}

**10. Special rhythms:**  
( = beginning of special rhythm  
) = end of special rhythm

The total duration value of the group must be written before the **(**. The rhythmic value of the first note must be
given after **(**, even if it is identical with that of the note immediately before the section of special rhythm. The
number of notes in the group must be indicated before **)**. It is separated from the last note by **;**.

_Examples:_

- 8(3ABCDE;5)   = quintuplet, five demisemiquavers/32nd notes, in the space of a quaver/eighth note.
- 8({3ABCDE};5) = quintuplet, five demisemiquavers/32nd notes, in the space of a quaver/eighth note, beamed

The triplet is a special case. Strictly speaking, it should be encoded as:  
8(6ABC;3) or 8({6ABC};3).  
Instead though, the following shortcut is permitted:  
(6ABC)  
({6ABC})

Please do not forget the rhythmic value within the bracket!

**11. Shortcuts**  
**Note:** Currently, the OPAC search ignores the repeated elements described in 11.1 and 11.2. This means that if you
use those shortcuts, your incipits will not be fully searchable by the OPAC. Until this is fixed, please write out the
incipit in full.  (Shortcut 11.3 may be used as described.)

11.1. Repeated figures  
! = beginning and end of passage  
f = repeat indication   
The figure will be repeated as often as **f** is repeated after the second **!**. This is only possible within a
bar/measure.

_Example:_

- !{'8ABAG}!ff = this figure will be repeated twice

11.2. Repeated bars/measures  
i = repeat last bar/measure  
'i' always goes between two bar lines.

_Example:_

- '4ABAG/i/i/ = the bar/measure will be repeated twice

**11.3. Rhythmic patterns**

When a certain rhythmic sequence is repeated several times, the rhythmic pattern can be given before the respective note
letter names.

_Example:_

- Instead of **8.A6B8C8.D6E8F** the code can be **8.68ABCDEF**
- The rhythmic sequence ends as soon a different rhythmic value occurs.

**12. Change of clef, key or time signature:**

Use **%** to change the clef, **$** to change the key, and **@** to change the time signature. Follow this with the new
indication (clef, key, or time), followed by a space.

_Examples:_

- %C-1 '2A
- %C-1 $xFC '8B
- @3/2 '1C
- $nBE $xFC

**13. Abbreviations**

Abbreviated forms of notation found within the music, such as tremolos or simile signs for repeats, must be written out
in full using the actual notation.

_Examples:_

- {'8DDDD} = minim/ half tremolo on D

**14. Chords**

Enter chords from the highest to the lowest note, separated by a **^**.

_Example:_

- 4â€™â€™C^â€™G^E^C

#### General note (031 $q)

Add any other comments, such as the pitch of transposing instruments, mistakes in the incipit, the text incipit with the
original spelling and/or punctuation, or any adjustments you had to make. Enter using your cataloging language.

#### Scoring in movement (031 $z)

In this field, you can indicate the specific scoring for the particular movement in question (such as a movement within
a complex vocal piece). List the scoring on one line using RISM instrument abbreviations and in the standard order (
described in **Scoring summary [240 $m]**). Use a semicolon to separate instrument families.

_Examples:_

- S (Enrico), T (Vanoldo); vl 1, 2, b; [winds]
- S 2 solo; Coro; ob obl; strings, bc
