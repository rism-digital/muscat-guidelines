# Authorities

The **Authorities** section of Muscat collects all authority files, controlled vocabulary, and indexes, and ensures that terminology is consistent throughout Muscat. Each of these is described in brief below. Full guidelines are included within each authority file.  

## Digital objects  

The digital objects database collects all of the images (typically watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings) and MEI incipits that are attached to records in Muscat. You can attach digital objects to sources, people, and institutions.

## Institutions

The authority file for institutions (corporate names) describes non-persons that appear in connection with a source or other authority record in Muscat. This authority file contains both modern institutions (such as a library with a RISM library siglum) and historical corporate bodies (such as a publisher or an orchestra). Institutions can be linked in the field **Additional institution (710 $a)** in Sources, **Related institution (710 $a)** in Institutions, **Associated institution (510 $a)** in Personal names, and **Additional institution (710 $a)** in Secondary literature.

## Liturgical festivals

The index of liturgical festivals collects religious holidays and feast days. Liturgical festivals can be linked in the field **Liturgical festival (657 $a)** in Sources.

## Personal names

The authority file for personal names describes all people that are connected to a source or other authority record in Muscat. Personal names can be linked in the fields **Composer/Author (100 $a)** and **Additional personal name (700 $a)** in Sources, **Person (700 $a)** in Institutions, **Related personal name (500 $a)** in Personal names, **Author (100 $a)** and **Additional personal name (700 $a)** in Secondary literature, and **Composer (100 $a)** in Work nodes. RISM is a contributor to [VIAF (Virtual International Authority File)](https://www.viaf.org/) so names contributed to RISM are sent to VIAF on a regular basis.

New names can be edited by the record owner for two months after creation. Catalogers are encouraged to fill out as much information in the authority record as they can, including links to VIAF, biographical information, and alternate spellings. After two months, control of the record goes to the Editorial Center. Additions are still welcome and can be communicated through the comment function or by sending an email to [Alexander Marxen](mailto:alexander.marxen@rism.info).

## Places

The index of places collects the names of locations, including historical geographic names. The index is built from places entered in the following fields: **Location of performance (651 $a)** in Sources, **Geographic name (551 $a)** in Personal names, **Related place (651 $a)** in Secondary Literature, and **Place (551 $a)** in Institutions.

## Secondary literature

The database of Secondary literature enables catalogs of works, thematic catalogs, books, articles, encyclopedias, online resources, critical editions, modern performing editions, etc. to be cited in Muscat records. Secondary literature is linked through the **Short tile (210 $a)** in the fields **Catalog of works (690 $a)** and **Bibliographic reference (691 $a)** in Sources, **Literature (670 $a)** in Institutions, and **Source data found (670 $a)** in Personal names.

## Subject headings

All subject headings, musical forms, and genres are collected here. Some records include translations or explanations as to the scope of the subject heading. Subject headings are linked through the field **Subject heading (650 $a)** in Sources and **Subject heading (650 $a)** in Secondary literature.

## Titles/Text incipits

The Title/Text incipits index collects the titles entered in Sources from the fields **Standardized title (240 $a)** and **Additional title (730 $a)**, as well as the text incipits entered in the field **Text incipit (031 $t)**.

## Work nodes  

The **Work nodes** serve as a link between sources in Muscat and external work authorities. Within Muscat, they group sources sharing the same external work authority ID number. A link to an existing, external work authority, preferably to the GND from the German National Library (DNB), is required to create a work node.

Work nodes are not exported as authority data, and work nodes do not have external ID numbers. They are linked in the source records through the field **External work reference (Work node) (930)**, and link to the external authority through that authority's work ID number.  

Contact the RISM Editorial Center if you wish to create work nodes.
