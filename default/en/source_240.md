### Standardized title (240)

The title is entered here in a standardized form, which brings together under the same title compositions which, despite
having a variety of names, are the same or similar. Also called the "filing title" or "uniform title."

#### Standardized title (240 $a)

**Required field.**

Indicate questionable information with a question mark at the end (for example, **Die Zauberflöte?** ). Do not use
brackets or parentheses. Put alternative versions of the title in the field **Additional title (730)**.

A standardized title can be generated from the following, in order of preference:

1. Distinctive titles
2. Text incipits
3. Genres
4. Tempo markings

1. **Distinctive titles**  
   Distinctive titles include all kinds of stage works, oratorios, cantatas, and songs, and also certain kinds of
   instrumental music (such as character pieces from the 18th century with a distinctive, individual title).

Enter the distinctive title in standard spelling as in (1) New Grove, (2) MGG, (3) catalogs of works, and/or (4) other
reference books. Do not omit initial articles (the, a, an, der, die, le, l', etc.).

Popular names or nicknames (such as "Eroica" or "Nelson Mass") do not count as standardized titles. Such names are
entered in the field **Additional titles (730 $a)**.

_Examples:_  
 - Die Forelle  
 - Die Zauberflöte  
 - The beggar's opera

2. **Text incipit**  
   Enter the text incipit as the standardized title for vocal pieces if there is no distinctive title.

If a source consists of a recitative and aria or a scena and aria, the text incipit of the aria is always used as the
standardized title. Apply the same principles to a recitative and cavatina, scena and rondo, or similar combinations. If
you have a single opera aria from an opera whose title is unknown, enter the text incipit of the aria.

With cantatas, on the other hand, the text of the first vocal piece functions as the standardized title, regardless of
whether it is a recitative, aria, or chorus.

However, use the genre for masses, requiems, obsequies, litanies, and compositions for the divine office. The same is
true for complete operas and oratorios whose titles are unknown.

When entering text incipits, use the orthographic rules of each respective language to dictate use of upper or lower
case letters. Capitalize the names of the deity (God, Herr, Dio, Dieu, Signore, Lord, etc.). Omit punctuation marks and
repetitions within the incipit. If the item is clearly a translation, enter the standardized title in the original
language.

Make sure that the text incipit in this field is identical with the text incipit in the field **Text incipit (031 $t)**.
With Latin texts, use the text that precedes the comma (from the list in the appendix) as a standardized title but use
the text incipit in its entirety for the text incipit.

_Examples:_  
 - Der Mond ist aufgegangen  
 - Gloria [with text incipit: Gloria, in excelsis Deo et in terra pax]

3. **Genre**  
   Use the genre of the piece as the standardized title if you have neither a distinctive title nor a text incipit. In
   most cases, enter the genre in English and in the plural (such as **Operas** ). Note that for some genres, a
   corresponding **Subject heading (650)** is used. Please consult the appendix **Standardized title – Subject heading**
   in the **Guidelines** for assistance.

_Examples:_  
 - Symphonies  
 - Allemandes

4. **Tempo indications**  
   Enter the tempo indication if the genre cannot be determined. If none of these options are available, use the
   following terms:  
   -Songs (vocal pieces)  
   -Pieces (a generic piece)  
   -Movements (a single movement of an instrumental piece without a tempo indication and of indeterminate character)

_Examples:_  
 - Presto  
 - Lento

**Special rules:**

- **Collections**. In these cases, a number plus the genre is entered. Enter an arabic numeral indicating how many
  works belong to the collection, followed by a genre that is as comprehensive as possible.  
  _Examples:_    
  25 Arias  
  3 Instrumental pieces
- **Composite volumes**. Enter a number corresponding to the number of items involved plus the word "Items."  
  _Example:_  
  11 Items
- **Variations.** Enter **Variations** as the standardized title here. In the field**Additional title (730)**, enter the
  piece the work is based on, when known, and select **Variations** next to **Arrangement statement**.
- **Insertions.** Enter the text incipit of the inserted piece as the standardized title here. In the field **Additional
  title (730)**, enter the name of the opera or larger work and select **Inserts** next to **Subheading.**
- **Non-Latin scripts.** If your source has a title that uses non-Latin letters or characters (
  Cyrillic/Greek/Hebrew/Korean etc. alphabet, Chinese characters, etc.) enter the **Standardized title** using the
  original script. Translations or transliterations are optional and may be added in the field **Additional title (
  730)**.

#### Arrangement statement (240 $o)

Select **Arrangement** if the work is an arrangement of another work.

Note that retextings and transpositions are not considered arrangements. In such cases, enter the name of the
responsible person, if known, under **Additional personal name (700)**. Although the works are not considered
arrangements, the person is referred to there as "Arranger".

Arrangements should also be distinguished from independent works (free elaborations), such as variations, paraphrases,
parodies, and fantasies on themes from the original work.

#### Subheading (240 $k)

This field is for special form aspects as applicable. Select from the following:

- **Excerpts** : if only one or several sections of the complete work are present
- **Fragments** : if only fragments of the work are present
- **Sketches:** if only sketches of the work are present

#### Key or mode (240 $r)

**Required if the key can be determined with certainty.**

Select the key of the entire work (even for excerpts).

In the case of arrangements, enter the key of the original work. If the original key cannot be determined, enter the key
of the source in hand; in this case, though, enter a corresponding note in the field **General note (500)**.

If no key is indicated on the source, select a key only if it can be determined with certainty.

Do not enter a key for: operas, oratorios, and cantatas; recitatives without an ensuing aria; and works for which a key
cannot be clearly established.

Do not translate modes into modern key names.

See “Ecclesiastical modes” for the Western and Byzantine church modes and “Keys” for the list of keys under **General
abbreviations and terms**.

#### Scoring summary (240 $m)

**Required field** **except for the following: operas and oratorios with the standard instrumentation V (X), Coro,
orch  
If you have sketches or collections, enter a scoring summary if it makes sense to do so. **

Enter a brief scoring (instrumentation) summary of the overall medium of performance for the work here. Separate each
element of the scoring summary with commas. Enter a maximum of four elements. A detailed description of the
instrumentation is entered in the field **Total scoring (594)**. The entire scoring summary goes in one line; repeat the
field only to indicate alternative instrumentations (see below).

Use terms from the **Abbreviations** list. Write out any terms that are not contained in this list in full and in
English.

Enter groups of instruments in the following order:

 - Solo voices
 - Chorus
 - Solo instruments
 - Strings
 - Woodwinds
 - Brass
 - Plucked instruments
 - Percussion
 - Keyboard instruments
 - Basso continuo

When more than one of the same voice or instrument is indicated, place the number in parentheses after the part
designation, such as **B (2)**. Use **V** to indicate an unknown vocal part and **i** for an unknown instrument. Also
use **V** to group together several different vocal parts, such as **V (8)**. Indicate an unknown number with **(X)**.

Specify solo instruments only if they have a continuous solo function in relation to an orchestra, especially in a solo
concerto. Do not list a part here if it only has occasional solo passages, such as an oboe solo in a section of a
cantata.

In the case of arrangements, the scoring summary refers to the personnel required in the present source, not in the work
on which an arrangement is based. If the instrumentation of the original work is known, specify it in the field **
General note (500)**. In the case of a **Collection** , only use the field if the particular scoring is applicable to
all the works contained in the collection.

This field may be repeated in cases where alternative instrumentation is suggested, such as a song that is for either
soprano or tenor. In such cases, enter each possible instrumentation in a separate field: for example, **S, pf** on one
line and **T, pf** on the next.

If you have a figured bass, enter the instrument as usual, such as **b** , **bc** , **org** , etc. (but see the tables
in the section **Figured bass in scores and/or parts** for guidance with related fields).

Omit the scoring summary if the performing forces are unknown or uncertain.

_Examples_:  
 - A, Coro, orch  
 - Bariton, pf  
 - V (3), strings, bc  
 - V (4), Coro, orch, org   _for a mass_  
 - cl, orch _ for a clarinet concerto_
