In cataloguing collections (a Convolutum or a Collection) redundancy should be avoided as far as possible. To this aim, the following rules apply:

1. Any statements which apply to the entire collection will be entered in the superordinate record (Convolutum or Collection). 
2. Any information that is relevant only for some parts of the collection will be entered in the corresponding subordinate record. 

A collection which contains at least one "Collection" and a single title and/or other "Collections" is called a "Convolutum". A collection on the other hand consists only of individual works.

### Cataloguing pasticcios and compilations 

Pasticcios and compilations are catalogued as a collection (usually as a "Collection"). Each part is entered separately as a subordinate record in a collection.
