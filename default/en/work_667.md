### Internal note (667)

Enter local notes for internal use, including within your own working group. Any language may be entered here. Internal notes are not published in the public RISM catalogs or available in the RISM open data. Local notes can be used for remarks of all kinds, such as questions, comments, or research to be done. Delete notes after they have served their purpose. It is best practice to sign your note using your initials and the date.
