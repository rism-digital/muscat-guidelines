### Additional institution (710)

The field **Additional institution** is to index any institution, organization, or other corporate body involved with the source, apart from the holding institution named in the field **Library siglum (852)**.   

Publishers named after people but acting out the function of publisher (Pleyel, André, etc.) are entered here. In the
case of self-published music, enter the name of the person in its natural form, such as Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf.

#### Institution (710 $a)

Enter the names of all institutions that appear on or are associated with the source. This field is linked to the **Institutions** authority file through $0 and the city (Place) through $c. 

#### Department (710 $b)

Enter, if necessary, the name of the unit of an institution, such as a department. Enter in the local language.

#### Attribution qualifier (710 $g)

Select an indicator to describe the level of certainty of the attribution if any of these situations apply. If not,
leave blank.

- **Alleged** means the name is present on the source, but the attribution is questionable or doubtful.
- **Ascertained** means the name is partially present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is (reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources, secondary literature, or other scholarly
  resources. This happens in most cases.
- **Conjectural** is a guess based on secondary evidence, such as secondary literature.
- **Misattributed** means the name is on the source but is incorrect.  

**Obsolete procedures** See the corresponding attribution field in the field **Composer/Author (100)**.  

#### Function (710 $4)
