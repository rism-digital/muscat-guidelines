### RISM ID number (001)  

The field **RISM ID number** is the permanent RISM identifier for the record. This number is automatically generated and cannot be
changed.  

In record imports, nine-digit RISM ID numbers are assigned. The first three digits of a nine-digit number indicate the contributing national group.

**Obsolete procedures**: In former RISM cataloging programs, the RISM ID number was entered by hand. The RISM ID number was nine digits in length and the first three digits indicated the national group. Some IDs started with three zeros, which may be ignored. This practice was discontinued with the introduction of Muscat.
