The Directory of Music Repositories of RISM-C is a subproject of IAML's Project Group on RISM Series C, a project to
locate and describe music archival fonds and collections on the fonds/collection level, using the International Standard
for Describing Institutions with Archival Holdings (ISDIAH). A necessary component of the description is data about the
holding institutions, places and directory. The proposal is to update the _Directory of Music Research Libraries_
developed by RISM. The project will begin with the two volumes containing fifteen European countries, published in
2001 (2nd edition), compiled and revised by Elizabeth Davies.

The relationship between this updating project and the RISM Series C project is the idea to add archival information to
the description of each institution, and a special section with information about the musical fonds preserved in each
institution, presented as a simple list with the names of the fonds or collections. This will provide an initial guide
of location information for fonds and collections prior to the complete description of them.

The idea is to involve both the national branches of IAML and RISM national groups in this updating of the RISM C
directory. In this way, the subproject will be a collaboration between all national branches of IAML and national
offices of RISM. The result will be accessible online through the RISM and IAML websites, and will be a powerful tool to
locate music libraries, archives and documentation centres as well as their holdings.

This guide presents guidelines for the practical matters involved in the updating of the paper version of the directory,
transforming it into an online database created by the RISM Editorial Center. Fields in this database are arranged
according to MARC21 and the guidelines are in accordance with ISDIAH in order to allow compatibility.
