**1. How can I add images?**

Small images such as watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings can be attached to the record directly from the editing mode: click on **Attach a new image** on the menu on the right.

Images such as digitized resources should only be added as links that link to the holding repository. These are added in the field **External resource (856)**.
