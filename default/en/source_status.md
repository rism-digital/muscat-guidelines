### Record status

The **Record status** records whether the records in Sources are published or unpublished. Only published records are available in the RISM catalogs and open data. The status can be
changed manually. The record status is applied to each record individually, regardless of whether the record is linked to other records (such as in a collection).  

The record status only applies to records created for musical sources, not for other areas of Muscat (such as authority files).  

#### Published  

Records from Muscat with the status **Published** are available in the public RISM catalogs and open data. All new Muscat records are automatically set to **Published**.

#### Unpublished  

Records with the status **Unpublished** are withheld from publication. Some RISM contributors wish to
keep this status until a project is complete, or individuals might want to wait until an item is fully cataloged
before publishing it (such as with extensive records that have lots of incipits or individual entries).

Please use this status judiciously. It is not good practice to unpublish records that were once publicly available, nor
is it ideal to keep records unpublished for a very long time.  

Multiple records can be published at once by adding them to a folder and publishing the contents of the folder.
