## Scope of printed music in RISM

RISM seeks to document printed music from the beginnings of music printing through around 1900.

In the course of the 20th century and up to today, we see a sharp increase in commercial music publishing and
distribution. The amount of music considered "rare" or undocumented elsewhereis much less when compared to previous
centuries. Music published by modern publishers, printed in large quantities, widely available, and meant for active use
by library patrons would be better documented in cooperative databases such as [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/).

RISM will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether to document music published in the 20th century by defunct
publishers or by smaller, regional publishers of historical significance; as well as modern editions included in the
course of cataloging a collection with historical value, such as the private library of an individual.

## When to input a new record

RISM treats each manuscript as a unique item and therefore each manuscript has its own RISM record. Printed materials
are different, however, in that multiple copies of the same edition can be described using the same record (in which
case you simply add your holdings information), but significant variants mean that a new record must be created.

The following offers guidelines as to which variants justify a new record and which do not. (This section draws heavily
from [Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Music)](http://rbms.info/dcrm/)).

**A new record is required** if your item shows one or more of these differences when compared to the RISM record:

- **Different content**: Differences in the title or authors/contributors. Edition statement that indicates
  corrections, revisions, expansions, abridgments, or the inclusion of supplementary materials

- **Different publisher.**
- **Different setting of the printing type**: Different plates (excluding replacement plates). Changes in the statement
of extent. Change in bibliographical or musical format. Differences in music line-endings and catchwords (revealed by
the comparison of multiple copies).
- **Different publication status**: An original title page has been canceled and replaced. A new label is covering the
original publication, distribution, production, etc., statement. Original sheets have been issued in a new publisher’s
cover bearing more recent information than that provided on the title page. Series title page is new.
- **Different plate and/or publisher numbers**.

**Do not create a new record** if your item has one of these differences. (If your item has _more than one_ of these
differences, you must decide if a new record is necessary.)

- Different statement of printing: For example, "Fifth printing"
- Different printer or other manufacturer but same publisher
- Different printing date but same publication date
- Different publisher’s cover that does not provide evidence of a discrete publishing unit (for example, a change of color
in publisher’s cloth)
- Different binding
- Different publisher’s advertisements or catalogs (unless they are integral to the publication)
- Corrections made in the course of a single press run (stop-press corrections)
- Presence or absence of an errata slip

These guidelines mean that a single record will be used to represent multiple impressions, states, and binding variants
relating to a single edition or issue. In your holdings information, you can enter details about variants and
information specific to your copy.

#### Examples:

1. You are looking at RISM number 1001031016: Beethoven, "Adelaide," op. 46, no date, Bonn, N. Simrock, text in German
   and French.Spelling error on title page: "à une vois [!] Seule".

   1. Copy 1: Same publication information but spelling has been corrected. This alone would not warrant a new record, but
there is an additional text language in Italian. **New record required** (different content/expansion). Result:
1001031017

   2. Copy 2: As copy 1, but a price has been engraved on the title page. **Do not create a new record** (no evidence of
discrete publishing unit). Add your holdings and mention the price in the holdings information.

   3. Copy 3: As RISM number 1001031016 (but spelling has been corrected), but an additional publisher is named: "chez L.
PLATTNER à ROTTERDAM." **New record required** (different publication status). Result: 1001031022

2. You are looking at RISM number 990055558 (A/I: R 2226): Romberg, Airs variés, op. 17, Offenbach, Jean André.

   1. Copy 1: Same title but a label has been stuck over the publication information: "Imported by William
   Forster...Strand." You can see that the label is covering up the Offenbach/André information. **New record
   required** (different publication status/label covers original publication information). Result: 1001031194

3. You are looking at RISM 990024126 (RISM A/I: G 5286). The RISM record represents a set of multiple symphonies. Each
   symphony is available as a separate publication with separate plate numbers, issued as _livres_ 1, 2, and 3.

   1. Option 1, the quick solution: If your library only has one of the items in the set, **add your holdings** and in the
   field "Material held" please note which symphony (livre) you have.
   2. Option 2, a better solution, but takes more time: **Notify the Editorial Center** about this record and we will split
   the record into 3, one record for each symphony. Then, add your holdings to the record for the symphony you have.

## Standardized titles for printed music

   **Distinctive titles**

   Printed music bears distinctive titles much more frequently than music manuscripts do. Please observe the following for
   the field **Standardized title (240)** when cataloging printed music.

   1. **Spelling**  
      Enter standardized titles using modern orthography, but do not overcorrect archaic usage or dialect/regionalisms.
      Frequent changes include _v_ to _u_, _i_ to _j_ , _y_ to _i_, and _uu_ to _w_. The Editorial Center can assist with
      unfamiliar foreign languages. Additional variations can be entered in the field **Additional title (730)**.

   _Examples:_

   - RISM A/I: RR 3030c
      - Title on source: Musicalische Grab=schrifft.
      - Standardized title: Musikalische Grabschrift

   2. **Deriving a standardized title**  
      Standardized titles should consist of the title of the print up to a natural break, frequently a comma, period, or a
      statement of the author, instrumentation, number, or imprint. Sometimes a distinctive title appears on a page other
      than the title page.

   _Examples:_

   - RISM A/I: B 805
      - Title on source: Vezzo di perle musicali modernamente conteste alla regia sposa effigiata nella sacra cantica; opera
     ventesima terza
      - Standardized title: Vezzo di perle musicali

   - RISM A/I: B 3781
      - Title on source: Novo giardino de concerti a quattro voci, per cantare a due chori con due voci, e due tromboni, o altri
   stromenti, o voci, secondo la comodità de cantori ... nel quale li contengono alquante antifone del cantico della Beata
   Virgine, di alcune solennità principali del anno, & altri motetti, con il basso principale per l'organo, opera
   undecima  
      - Standardized title: Novo giardino de concerti

   **Generic titles**

   Even generic titles, especially in older imprints, are frequently cited in the literature as if they were distinctive
   titles. Use the field **Additional title (730)** to enter such titles in a standardized form. For guidance, refer to
   standard reference works such as Grove and MGG, and authority files from
   the [Library of Congress](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html) or [VIAF](http://www.viaf.org/). If the title
   indicates that the item has an affiliation with another item, such as libro/Buch/livre or Teil/part/tomus, enter the
   component in the original language (but standardized spelling) and the arabic number following the title.

   _Examples_:

   - RISM A/I: P 687
      - Title on source: CANTVS | IOANNIS PETRALOYSII | PRAENESTINI | Missarum cum quatuor, quinque, & sex vocibus. | LIBER
   DVODECIMVS. | Nunc primum in lucem editus. | VENETIIS, Apud Haeredem Hieronymi Scoti. MDCI  
      - Standardized title: 6 Masses  
      - Additional title: Missarum, liber 12

   - RISM A/I: SS 6593a  
      - Title on source: Ander Theil | Der Preussischen | Fest-Lieder/ | Von Ostern an biß Advent | Mit 5/ 6/ 7/ 8. Stimmen. |
   JOHANNIS ECCARDI MULHUSINI THURINGI, | vnd | JOHANNIS STOBAEI GRUDENTINI BORUSSI. | Beyder Chur: vnd Fürstlicher
   Brandeb. Capell= | meistern in Preussen. | DISCANTVS. | Gedruckt zu Königsberg durch Johann Reusnern An: 1644.  
      - Standardized title: Preussische Festlieder  
      - Additional title: Preussische Festlieder, Teil 2

## Multiple copies in one institution

If your institutions owns multiple copies (exemplars) of the same printed edition, create a separate holdings record for each copy.
