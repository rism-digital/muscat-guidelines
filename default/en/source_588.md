### Source of description note (588)  

The field **Source of description note** specifies which physical item (exemplar) was consulted for cataloging a printed edition.

#### Copy examined for cataloging (588 $a)

Enter the library siglum and shelfmark of the printed edition consulted. You can also indicate if you used a copy for
only a portion of the record, such as incipits or individual entries.  

##### Examples

- CZ-Nlob X A a 12
- (incipits:) US-BETm LCM 242

If you use a secondary source as a basis for the record, fill out this field as usual but specify the secondary source
in a **General note (500)** and link to it as a catalog of works or bibliographic reference.

##### Example

- **Copy examined for cataloging (588)**: GB-Lbl h.11.a.(1.)
- **General note (500)**: Record based on YouV using the description of the copy in GB-Lbl, shelfmark h.11.a.(1.).
- **Catalog of works (690)**: YouV 2  

#### Using incomplete copies  

If your material is incomplete, add "(incomplete)" after your siglum and shelfmark, and include a **General note (500)** so it is clear to future readers that the record contains only partial information. Other cataloging-related information can be put in an **Internal note (599)** so that future holding libraries know what parts of the record can still be enhanced.  

##### Example

**Copy examined for cataloging (588)**: GB-Lbl 123 (incomplete)
- **General note (500)**: Record based incomplete copy in GB-Lbl 123. Vl 1 part missing.
- **Internal note (599)**: Note to future libraries: record created based on incomplete copy; check the extent of the vl 1 part and modify record accordingly.
