<br><h3>Using Muscat<br></h3><ol><li><b>Where can I find tutorials about Muscat?</b><br><span>All of the tutorials are linked on the RISM Editorial Center's Muscat page: <a target="_blank" href="https://rism.info/community/muscat.html">https://rism.info/community/muscat.html<br><br></a></span></li><li><b>How can I contact other Muscat users?</b><span><br>
To contact the Muscat developers: Report any errors, questions, comments, or
suggestions to muscat@rism.info at any time. <br>
<br>
<b><a target="_blank" href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rism-muscat">RISM Muscat</a></b>, <span>a Google Group, is
the official Muscat discussion list that each Muscat user must join. Official
announcements from the Editorial Center and the Muscat developers will be disseminated solely through this group. In addition, all Muscat users are
encouraged to ask questions or raise topics for discussion. <br>
<br>
A Google account is not required. An invitation to join the group will be sent
to you when you receive your Muscat account information.<br><br>There is also a
discussion channel on Slack at: <br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://rismcommunity.slack.com/">https://rismcommunity.slack.com/</a></span><br><br>
</span></li><li><b>Is
all secondary literature cited in Muscat at the Editorial Center?</b><br>No, only
the literature labeled "HB" or "Handbibliothek" or
"RISM-ZR" in an internal note (599) is actually in our office. Those materials are for the
benefit of all RISM contributors, so if we have a publication that you would
like to consult, let us know and we will try to get you what you need. Even if
you are interested in a publication we do not have in the office, there's a
chance that we know someone who has it.<br><br></li><li><b>What do
I do if I forget my password or want to change it?</b><br>Passwords
are managed by the Editorial Center. Contact us if you lose your password.
You cannot change your password.<br><br></li><li><b>Can I show Muscat to my colleagues? Can I demonstrate Muscat at
     conferences or in workshops?</b><br><span>Yes, please do! A training version of Muscat is available for exactly
     these purposes at <a target="_blank" href="https://muscat-training.rism.info/">https://muscat-training.rism.info</a>. <br><br>All Muscat users can
login there with their personal credentials. There are also 99 training
accounts ("training01@rism.info" to "training99@rism.info")
available for individual users. Any of these training accounts can be used.
Please contact the RISM Editorial Center (contact@rism.info) for the current password.</span><br><br>Anything on the training version can be added, edited or deleted. It is synchronized once a week (on Sunday) with the current Muscat data. This
     means that the new records will then be available but also that the ones
     created on the training version will be erased. <br><br></li><li><b>In the modification history, what
     does it mean if "[system]" is listed as the author?</b><br>You might see a system edit if one of the indexed fields linked to your
     record was changed. The change in the authority record will also register
     as a change in your record.<br><br></li><li><b><span>Can I create records based on descriptions from printed
     catalogs or online library catalogs?<br>
     </span></b><span>Yes! Sometimes, for
various reasons, it is not possible to access the source in person and the only
description available is in a printed catalog, catalog of works, or online
library catalog. You may use such descriptions as the basis for your record. <br>
When doing so:<br>a.</span> In<span>clude
a <b>General note (500)</b> such as
"Record based on description in YouV" </span><span><br>b. Link to the catalog in the field <b>Bibliographic reference (691)</b> or <b>External
      resource</b> (856) as appropriate</span> <br>c. <span>In the field Record origin (980),
      subfield <b>Material examined</b>, select <b>Material not examined</b> <br><br></span></li><li><b>Can I enter sources that
     are included in other RISM publications from the B series?</b><span><br>Though we are gradually adding sources from the B series to Muscat, this is a long-term project. Records from B/I are in Muscat while
     B/II is in preparation. In the meantime, please feel free to enter sources from other B volumes. Include a citation to the original B volume in the field <b>Secondary
     literature (691)</b>.<br></span>

<br></li><li><b>When do records appear in the public catalog at opac.</b><b>rism.info?</b><span><br>Muscat records are sent for publication in the public catalog at
     opac.rism.info once a month, at around the 19th of each month. Records are
     then visible a few days later.<br><br></span></li><li><b>What if a source in RISM is no longer in the
hands of the holding institution indicated in the RISM record?</b><span><br>Use the siglum <b>N. N. </b>for situations in which the
current location of a source is unknown, such as if it was on deposit at an
institution but the source was taken back and is now in private hands. This
happens only rarely. Contact the Editorial Center if a source needs this siglum.</span><br></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>
