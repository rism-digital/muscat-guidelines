<p><b>Required field.</b></p>

<p><span>Enter subject keywords or genre
terms here. This field is linked to the index <b>Subjects</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>



<p>The keyword should apply to the
entire work or the original work on which a piece is based, even in the case of
arrangements, excerpts, or single movements. In the case of sections of larger
vocal works, enter the genre of the excerpt in question (such as Arias,
Marches) as well as that of the entire work. </p>



<p>Each record should be given a
subject heading that relates to the standardized title. This field is particularly
important for works whose genre is not named in the standardized title.
Multiple subject headings may be selected; it is up to the cataloger to
determine the appropriate order.</p>

</p><p><span>Note that for certain types of genres
used as standardized titles, a corresponding <b>Subject heading (650)</b> is used. Please consult the appendix <b>Standardized title – Subject heading</b><span> in the <b>Guidelines</b></span>
for assistance. </span></p>
