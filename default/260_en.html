</p><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">For
printed music: If the original publishing information is covered by a
label or otherwise crossed out or altered, and new information is
provided in its place, enter the new information in this field. If you
can read the original publishing information or if the original
publishing information is otherwise available, you may also enter it by repeating the field. An explanatory note in the
field <b>General note (500)</b> may be necessary. </span>
</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Place (260 $a)</h4>

<p>For printed material, enter the place of
publication as given on the source. <span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Multiple
places of publication can be entered by clicking on the plus
sign (+) to the left of the text field.</span> For manuscripts, enter the place where a
manuscript was produced if it is indicated on the source. </p>

<p><span>If the place is not identified on a print,
enter <b>[s.l.]</b>. For manuscripts, leave
blank.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Publisher, copyist (260 $b)</h4>

<p>


	
	
	
	


</p><p>For
printed material,
enter the name of the publisher, publishing company, importer,
or distributor as given on the source. 
</p>

<p><span>For manuscripts, enter
the name of the copyist as it appears on the source. <br></span></p><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Always enter the standardized
forms of the names in the fields <b>Additional
personal name (700) </b>or <b>Additional
institution (710)</b>. Publishers named after people but acting out the function of
publisher</span><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"> (Pleyel,
Andr√©, etc.) are
entered as institutions.</span></p>



<p><span>If the name of the publisher or distributor is not
identified on a print, enter <b>[s.n.]</b>. (Do not index [s.n.] as
an additional institution).
For manuscripts, leave blank.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Date (260 $c)</h4>

<p></p><p>

</p>

<p>Enter the date of the source. Use arabic numerals (such as 1624 instead of MDCXXIV). Keep in mind that this
field is for the date of the material source itself, not for the work notated
in the source. 

















If the source contains an obvious error (such as
a typographical error), enter the correct date in this field. &nbsp;



</p>



<p>For manuscripts: Always try to give a date,
even if it is approximate. If you have a month, day, and year, write it in this
form: YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p><span>You may indicate approximate dates in your cataloging language by using the
following: <b>ca.</b> for circa, <b>before</b>, and <b>after</b>.&nbsp; Try to indicate the date as exactly as possible. If
you are uncertain, use a date range that corresponds to a non-specific period,
such as the eighteenth century or the end of the seventeenth century. See the
table below.</span></p>

<p><span>For prints: If you have a print but it is undated,
either enter an approximate date in brackets or enter <b>[s.d.]</b>. </span><span>Please make an effort
to supply a reasonable date range for an undated print, such as by using the
life dates of the composer or arranger as a<i> terminus post quem</i>, or the active
years of a publisher.</span></p><p>

</p><p>Note that for manuscripts, dates are given
without brackets because manuscripts are rarely dated. Printed materials, by
contrast, typically include a date so any editorial guess should be in
brackets.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Other dates may be indicated as on the source.
Use question marks to indicate uncertain information.</p>
