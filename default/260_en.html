places of publication can be entered by clicking on the plus
sign (+) to the left of the text field.</span> For manuscripts, enter the place where a
manuscript was produced if it is indicated on the source. </p>

<p><span>If the place is not identified on a print,

<h4>Publisher, copyist (260 $b)</h4>

<p>


	
	
	
	


</p><p>For
printed material,
enter the name of the publisher, publishing company, importer,
or distributor as given on the source. 
</p>

<p><span>For manuscripts, enter
the name of the copyist as it appears on the source. <br></span></p><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Always enter the standardized
forms of the names in the fields <b>Additional

André, etc.) are
entered as institutions.</span></p>



<p><span>If the name of the publisher or distributor is not
identified on a print, enter <b>[s.n.]</b>. (Do not index [s.n.] as
an additional institution).
For manuscripts, leave blank.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Date (260 $c)</h4>

<p></p><p>

</p>

<p>Enter the date of the source. Use
arabic numerals (such as 1624 instead of MDCXXIV).</p>



<p>For manuscripts: Always try to give a date,
even if it is approximate. If you have a month, day, and year, write it in this
form: YYYY-MM-DD.</p>

<p><span>You may indicate approximate dates in your cataloging language by using the
following: <b>ca.</b> for circa, <b>before</b>, and <b>after</b>.&nbsp; Try to indicate the date as exactly as possible. If
you are uncertain, use a date range that corresponds to a non-specific period,
such as the eighteenth century or the end of the seventeenth century. See the
table below.</span></p>

<p><span>For prints: If you have a print but it is undated,
either enter an approximate date in brackets or enter <b>[s.d.]</b>.</span></p><p>

</p><p>Note that for manuscripts, dates are given
without brackets because manuscripts are rarely dated. Printed materials, by
contrast, typically include a date so any editorial guess should be in
brackets.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Other dates may be indicated as on the source.
Use question marks to indicate uncertain information.</p>
