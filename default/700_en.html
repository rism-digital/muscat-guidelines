<h3>Additional personal name (700)<br></h3><p><span>This field appears
twice for sources. It appears in the section <b>People and institutions</b> to list all
additional people involved with the source. It is also in the section <b>Material

additional names with particular material groups, especially when creating multiple material groups</span>.<br><br></p>

<p></p>

<h4>Name (700 $a) </h4>

personal names that appear on the source. This field is linked to the <b>Personal names</b> authority file. Names not yet in the authority
file may be added.&nbsp; <br></span></p><p><span>Publishers named after people but acting out the function of publisher (Pleyel, Andr√©, etc.) are entered as an <b>Additional institution (710)</b>.<br></span></p>

<p>In the case of parent
records for collections or composite volumes, enter a name only if the name
applies to all the works in the collection. Enter names associated with
individual works in the individual records. <br><br></p>

</p><p>Select an indicator to describe the level of certainty of the attribution
if any of these situations apply. If not, leave blank.<br></p><ul><li><b>Alleged </b>means the name is present on
     the source, but&nbsp;the attribution is questionable or doubtful.</li><li><b>Ascertained </b>means the name is partially
     present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is
     (reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources,
     secondary literature, or other scholarly resources. This happens in most
     cases.</li><li><b>Conjectural </b>is a guess based on secondary
     evidence, such as secondary literature. </li><li><b>Doubtful</b>
     means the authorship is in question. </li><li><b>Misattributed </b>means the name is on the source

</p><p><b>Required field if "Name" is filled out.</b></p>

<p></p><p>Assign each person an exact
function. A person can be entered multiple times with different functions. A reduced list of
functions is offered in the holdings information for printed items. The
three-letter codes refer to the MARC relator code.</p><p>Keep in mind that when some people are named on sources, an institution is actually meant, such as with printers, publishers, or papermakers. In such cases, enter them as institutions.</p><p><br><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"></span></p>
