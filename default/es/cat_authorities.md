The **Authorities** section of Muscat collects all authority files, controlled vocabulary, and indexes. We like to think of it as mini databases within Muscat.



### Digital objects

The digital objects database collects all the images (usually watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings as well as MEI incipits) that catalogers upload into Muscat and attach to their records through the **Attach a new image** link in the source editing mode.



### Institutions

The authority file for institutions (corporate names) is for non-persons that appear in connection with a source.



### Liturgical festivals

The index of  liturgical festivals collects religious holidays and feast days. New liturgical festivals may be added in consultation with the Editorial Center.



### Personal names

New authority records for people are created when you enter a new name when cataloging a source, or when you click **Create** to create a new record in the personal names authority file.

In the editing mode for personal names, you can search and import data from VIAF through a button on the sidebar. You are also free to fill out as much information in the authority record as you wish.

After you enter a new name, you can edit it for the next two months. This is useful if you find alternate spellings of a name, for example, or if you have additional biographical information you wish to add. After that, control of the record goes to the Editorial Center. Additions are still welcome and can be communicated through the comment function or by sending an e-mail to alexander.marxen@rism.info.


### Places

The index of places collects the names of locations, including historical geographic names.



### Secondary literature

This bibliographic database contains information about all forms of secondary literature: catalogs of works, thematic catalogs, books, articles, encyclopedias, online resources, critical editions, modern performing editions, etc.  By clicking on "Create," a new work of secondary literature may be added.



### Subject headings

All subject headings, forms, and genres are collected here. Some records include explanations as to the scope of the subject heading. If you need a subject heading that is not in our list, please let us know and we will create one for you.

### Titles / Text incipits

This authority file contains both the titles entered in the field **Standardized title (240 $a)** and the text incipits entered in the field **Text incipit (031 $t)**.

### Works

An authority record for a work is for all information that is true for a work as a whole, no matter what other forms a piece of music exists in, whether it be—for example—an arrangement, a translation, a full score, or a single manuscript. Authority records can include the composer, title, title variants, key, instrumentation, and incipits, though it is not always an easy matter to decide what constitutes a separate "work."

Associating a musical source in Muscat with an authority record for a work ensures that all instances of any given piece of music are linked together. This improves the searchability of the catalog and helps users find all relevant sources, regardless of whether, for example, one manuscript calls the famous Mozart opera "Die Zauberflöte" and another is labeled "The Magic Flute," or a small chamber music piece is called a "duet" on one manuscript but a "sonata" on another. Beyond Muscat, in the linked data environment, information on works—and the associated RISM records—can be integrated into web searches, online encyclopedias, and other external databases.

Links to authority records for works are made in the field 930 in every bibliographic record for a musical source. Works not in the authority file must be created first before a link can be made.

#### Creating a new authority record for a work

Please contact the RISM Editorial Center if you wish to create authority records for works.

Please refer, in general, to the guidelines for the respective field in the Sources module.

When you open a template to create a new authority record for a work, use the **VIAF search** to look in VIAF to see if the work is already there, and click **select** to transfer the data to your authority record and make the link to VIAF. Note that only the field 100 is searched (i.e., composer name, scoring summary, opus/thematic catalog number, key, and title), so searching for variants is not possible. Keep in mind that different VIAF contributors have different ways of expressing works, so expect variations in the formulation of titles, instruments, and even thematic indexes. A good strategy is to search by composer name plus the number of the opus/thematic index.

After you import the data from VIAF, note that it may be necessary to clean up some fields in the field **Heading (100)** to conform to RISM standards. Do not delete or edit imported information in the field **Name variants (400)**.
