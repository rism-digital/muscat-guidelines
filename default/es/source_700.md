### Nombre personal adicional (700)

The field **Additional personal name** is to index all additional people involved with the source, apart from the name indexed in the field **Composer/Author (100)**.

#### Nombre personal adicional (700)

Enter all additional personal names that appear on the source as well as names that can be inferred. This field is linked to the **Personal names** authority file through $0 and life dates are displayed in $d. Names not yet in the authority file may be added. Do not use **Anonymus** in this field.

Publishers named after people but acting out the function of publisher (Pleyel, André, etc.) are entered as an **Additional institution (710)**.

In the case of parent records for collections or composite volumes, enter a name only if the name applies to all the works in the collection. Enter names associated with individual works in the child records.

#### Attribution (700 $j)

Seleccione un calificador para describir el nivel de certeza de la atribución, en caso de que se dé alguna de las situaciones siguientes. Si no es el caso, deje el campo en blanco.

- **Supuesta** significa que el nombre está presente en la fuente, pero la atribución es cuestionable o dudosa.
- **Ascertained** means the name is partially present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is (reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources, secondary literature, or other scholarly resources. Esto sucede en la mayoría de los casos.
- **Conjetural** refiere a una suposición basada en evidencia secundaria (por ej., bibliografía secundaria)
- **Mal atribuida** significa que hay un nombre en la fuente pero es incorrecto.

**Obsolete procedures** See the corresponding attribution field in the field **Composer/Author (100)**.

#### Nombre (700 $a)

**Required field if "Name" is filled out.**

Assign each person an exact function. A person can be entered multiple times with different functions. A reduced list of functions is offered in the holdings information for printed items. The three-letter codes refer to the MARC relator code.

Keep in mind that when some people are named on sources, an institution is actually meant, such as with printers, publishers, or papermakers. In such cases, enter them as institutions.
