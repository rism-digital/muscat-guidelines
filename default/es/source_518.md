### Note on performance (518)

The field **Note on performance** is for information related to how the source in hand was used in a specific performance. Remarks about performances of the work in general (rather than the source specifically), if relevant, should be entered in the field **General note (500)**.

For printed music, this field should be filled out in the core bibliographic record only in the case of occasional prints (that is, music written for a specific occasion). Performances specific to a certain copy of a printed edition should be entered in the holdings information.
