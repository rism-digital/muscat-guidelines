#### 1. How can I add images to a record?

Small images such as watermarks, handwriting samples, or bindings can be attached to the record directly from the editing mode: click on **Attach a new image** on the menu on the right. See the section **Digital objects** for more details.

Images such as digitized resources should only be added as URLs that link to the holding repository. These are added in the field **External resource (856)**.

#### 2. How can I change the order of fields in my record?

It's quite simple: just click on the arrow and drag up or down. Any repeatable field (designated by a **+** sign) can be organized this way, such as items in a collection, incipits, names, instruments, notes, etc.

#### 3. How can I add special characters?

Muscat supports Unicode (UTF-8), so make sure than any special characters are Unicode compliant. See, for example, [unicode-table.com](https://unicode-table.com/) for Unicode characters.

#### 4. How can I create and use folders?

Folders can be created from any of the search pages for sources or authorities in Muscat. Folders can aid searching, and folders can be used to perform bulk actions through the Folder view. Folder sizes are limited to 25,000 records.

##### Creating and adding to folders
There are two ways to create folders. From the search page, select records by checking the box on the left next to each record. Under **Batch actions** above the list of records on the upper left, click on **Create folder with items**. Name the folder and click **OK.** From **Batch actions** you can also add records to an existing folder. This method enables up to 100 records (the maximum number of results on a search page) to be added to a new or existing folder. The record selection is preserved only on the current page of results.

The second way to create a folder is to perform any search and then look for the **Actions** list on the right-hand side of the page. By clicking on **Add all to a new folder**, all results from the search will be added to a new folder. Name the folder and save. By clicking on **Add all to an existing folder,** you can select the folder from the list of folders. This method enables up to 25,000 records (a folder's maximum size) to be added to a folder.

##### Searching with folders

On the search page, the filters include a drop-down menu called **Is in folder.** Select your folder to limit results to records that are only in that folder.

##### Performing bulk actions

On the main Folders page, you can click **View** to view the contents of any folder, **Edit** to change the name of your folders, and **Delete** to delete the folder. (The records in the folder will not be deleted.)

When viewing your folder, the **Publish** button will change the status of the records from unpublished to published. You can also **Export** the contents of the folder as MARCXML or a CSV file, which is sent by email. **Validate** runs the records through Muscat's standard validation and the report is sent by email.

##### Managing folders

Muscat folders are visible to all Muscat users. Links to folders can be sent to other catalogers. Folders expire after six months, but the expiration date can be reset in the folder view.

#### 5. How can I export records from Muscat?

There are several ways retrieve Muscat records in various formats. Single records can be viewed in XML format by appending **.xml** to any record's URL in the full record view or by clicking the **Show XML** button from the menu on the right-hand side of the page. The MARC21 format can be displayed by clicking the **Show MARC21** button from the menu. You can also create a folder of records and export them in MARCXML or CSV format (see question 4, above).

#### 6. How can I check for errors in older records?

When viewing one of your own folders, click the **Validate items** link. You will receive an email with a list of validation errors found.

#### 7. How can I include more complex music incipits with my records?

If you create a music incipit with an external program (such as a full score in Sibelius) and convert it to MEI, the MEI file can be uploaded to Muscat. Currently, only the Editorial Center can do this; contact us for assistance. This will be displayed as an image in the online catalog. A separate Plaine & Easie incipit must be made in order for the incipit to be searchable.

#### 8. How can I delete a record?

Only the Editorial Center can delete a record. Notify the RISM Editorial Center if you need to delete a record, including holdings information.

#### 9. What if my record is in the wrong template?

Templates can be changed, but only the Editorial Center can do this. Notify the RISM Editorial Center if you need the template of a record to be switched.
