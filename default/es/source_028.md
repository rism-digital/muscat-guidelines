### Plate or publisher number (028)

This field is for publisher numbers and plate numbers, which typically appear on printed items but can also be found on manuscripts that were copied from a printed music edition.

#### Publisher or plate number (028, indicators 20 for plate number; 028, indicators 30 for publisher number)

Select the kind of number from the drop-down menu. A publisher number is usually found only on the title page. A plate number is usually found at the bottom of each page; include such numbers even if the music was not printed from plates.

#### Number (028 $a)

Enter the publisher number or plate number exactly as it appears on the source. If the number uses roman numerals, follow this with the corresponding arabic numerals in square brackets.

Enter only one publisher number or plate number per field, but repeat the field if both kinds or multiple numbers are present. If the publisher number is identical with the plate number, the publisher number does not need to be entered separately. Enter all plate numbers found on the source, checking all pages in case multiple plate numbers are present. If a number range is given, enter the range as given on the source and also add each full number separately.

The statement "[without plate number]" in English is allowed and serves to convey to others that you checked the source for plate numbers but they are lacking.
