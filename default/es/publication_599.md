### Internal note (599)

#### Nota interna (599 $a)

Use este campo para registrar notas locales para uso interno. Internal notes are not visible in the RISM catalogs or in the RISM open data. Local notes can be used for comments of all kinds, such as questions, comments, or research to be done. Borre las notas después de que hayan cumplido su propósito. It is best practice to sign your note using your initials and the date.

If an item is held by the Editorial Center in Frankfurt, add the note: **RISM-HB** for items in the reference library or **RISM-HB (PDF)** for items on the shared drive. (Likewise, if you see this note in an item you need, please feel free to contact the Editorial Center staff and we are happy to look something up for you or make you a copy.)
