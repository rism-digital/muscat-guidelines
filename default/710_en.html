<h3>Additional institution (710)<br></h3><p><span>This field appears
twice for sources. It appears in the section <b>People and institutions</b> to list all
additional institutions, organizations, or other corporate bodies involved with
the source. It is also in the section <b>Material description </b>if you wish to associate additional
institutions with particular materials groups, especially when creating multiple
material groups</span>.</p><p>Publishers named after people but acting out the function of publisher (Pleyel, André, etc.) are entered here. In the case of
self-published music, enter the name of the
person in its natural form, such as Bernhard Christoph Breitkopf.</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Institution (710 $a) </h4>

<p><span>Enter the names of
all institutions that appear on or are associated with the source. This field is linked
to the <b>Institutions</b> authority file. Names not
yet in the authority file may be added.<br><br></span></p>

name of the unit of an institution, such as a department. Enter in the local language.<br><br></p>

     the source, but&nbsp;the attribution is questionable or doubtful.</li><li><b>Ascertained </b>means the name is partially
     present or entirely absent from the source, but attribution is
     (reasonably) certain and based on comparison with concordant sources,
     secondary literature, or other scholarly resources. This happens in most
     cases.</li><li><b>Conjectural </b>is a guess based on secondary
     evidence, such as secondary literature. </li><li><b>Doubtful</b>
