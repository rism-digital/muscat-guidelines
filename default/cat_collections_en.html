</p><p>

</p><p>This section describes how to catalog
special types of sources: collections, composite volumes, contrafacta,
compilations, insertion arias, parodies, mixed materials (manuscripts and printed items stored
together), music in periodicals, music in non-music publications, libretti, treatises,
and piano arrangements.</p>

<p></p><h3>Cataloging collections</h3>

<p></p>

<p>


	
	
	
	


</p><p>


	
	
	
	


</p><p>In
RISM, a <i>collection</i>
is both an intentional collective
manuscript or anthology of multiple works
as well as an
item that contains two or more separate
pieces. The
latter means that if a manuscript for a
piano sonata, for example, also
has a sketch for a fugue at
the very end, RISM would catalog it as a
collection with a parent record for the item as a whole and
individual entries for the sonata and the
fugue. 
</p>





<p>When cataloging collections,
please note that:</p>

<ol><li>The collection main entry
     (parent record) should contain information that applies to the entire
     collection. </li><li>Any information that is
     relevant only for some sections of the collection should be entered in the
     individual entry. </li></ol>

<p>If the
works in the collection have different composers, scoring, source types, etc., then do not
enter them in the parent record. </p>

<p>For
collections in which the works are very similar, it is a good strategy to create
a full first entry and use the "Duplicate" function to copy the
record. Then for the following records you only have to change fields such as title
and page number. </p>

<p>

</p>

<p></p><p>
</p><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Collection
parent records may not contain collection parent records of manuscripts. Instead,
use a flatter hierarchy by means of individual records and explain the structure, makeup, or
organization of the item in a note. <br></span></p><p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">

</span></p><p>

</p><h3><br></h3><p>

</p><h3>Cataloging a composite volume</h3>

<span>A <b>composite volume</b> consists of items
that were created separately but later bound together, typically by an owner or
institution. </span>There
are other names for such volumes: binders' collections, binders' volume, bound
sheet music, bound-with, collectors' volume, factitious  volume, nonce volumes, recueils
factices, Sammelband, tract volume. Composite volumes include volumes in which
individual printed items are bound together, as well as volumes in which
printed items and manuscripts are bound together. <br><br>There are two ways to indicate a composite
volume. The first, and simplest, way is to give the items the same shelfmark; a
bound-with note is also helpful. The second is to use the template for
composite volumes. <br><br>The composite volume record serves as means to
link all bound items to a single record, thus providing the user with a
convenient overview of the entire contents of a bound item.



<p>Records for a composite volume should be kept
simple. As with collection parent records, the information given in the
composite volume record should be true for all of the components of the volume,
and remember that detailed information related to the music belongs in the
respective bibliographic records. Do not create separate records for multiple
composite volumes that belong together, such as a set of partbooks bound by
voice type; these should be described in the same record. In many cases, you will
be leaving a lot of fields blank.</p>

<p><span>You will be linking either a manuscript item
or a printed item to a record for a composite volume, and they are
linked differently. <br></span></p><p></p><p>

</p><ol><li>First, create the record for the composite
volume, save, and note the RISM number.</li><li><span>For manuscripts: In the editing mode of the
record for your manuscript, go to the field <b>Parent record (773)</b>. Click the second button to search for the composite volume. <br></span></li><li><span>For printed music: In the holdings
information for the printed edition, find the field <b>Bound with (973)</b> and
click the magnifying glass. Find the record for the composite volume and select
it.</span></li></ol><h3>

Cataloging contrafacta</h3><p></p>

Contrafacta
are vocal pieces in which the text is changed without significant change to the
music, such as retexting a secular work with sacred text, or the other way
around. The derivation is almost mechanical; there is little creativity on the
part of the arranger, but there is a significant change in the musical purpose
(such as from a theatrical context to a religious one).<br><br>Please
note that RISM considers contrafacta to be separate from parody and parody
masses, which typically involve a more significant transformation of the
musical material.<br><br>Take
note of the following fields when cataloging contrafacta. RISM ID no. 300234487,
a sacred contrafactum of an aria from Josef Mysliveček's opera Il Bellerofonte,
will be used as an example.&nbsp;

<p><b><br>Composer
(100)</b><br>Enter
the composer of the original music.</p><p></p><ul><li>Mysliveček, Josef</li></ul><p>

</p><p><b>Standardized title (240)</b><br><span>Use the standardized
title of the original piece. <b>Excerpts</b> may be added. Do not use <b>Arr</b>.</span></p>

<p></p><ul><li>Il Bellerofonte. Excerpts</li></ul><p>

</p><p><b>Alternative
title (730)</b><br>If there
is a new, distinct standardized title for the piece in hand, you can enter it
here. Do not enter text incipits here.</p>



<p><b>Subject
headings (650)</b><br>Add at
least 3 subject headings (more if appropriate), in this order:<br>Contrafacta<br>Current
genre<br>Original
genre<br></p><p></p><ul><li>Contrafacta</li><li>Sacred songs</li><li>Operas</li></ul><p>

</p><p><b>Description

short description in English that explains the situation as a benefit to other
RISM users.<br></p><p></p><ul><li>Sacred contrafactum of an aria from Mysliveček's
opera Il Bellerofonte.</li></ul><p>

</p><p><b>Language
of text (041)</b><br>Fill out
both of these fields:<br>Language

<p></p><ul><li>Language of text: Latin</li><li>Language of original text: Italian</li></ul><p>

</p><p><b>Text

incipit of the original text, if known, in brackets.</p>

<p></p><ul><li>Alma redemptoris mater, quae pervia caeli</li><li>[Giusti dei che ben vedete]</li></ul><p>

</p><p><b>Other
fields</b></p>

All other fields, such as liturgical feasts and
instrumentation, should refer to the source in hand, that is, the contrafactum
itself, and not the original work on which it was based.<br><br><p></p><p>

</p><h3>Cataloging
compilations </h3>

<p>Compilations are new, independent works
made from parts of one or more other works and can also include new material.
Frequently, the resulting work is of a different genre than the component
parts, such as when arias or duets from an opera become a cantata, or excerpts from
an opera become an instrumental suite. This also includes pasticcios. While the
boundary between a compilation and a pasticcio is not always clear, pasticcios
can be generally be characterized by one of these features: (1) arias, duets,
or larger parts of dramatic works that are adapted to a new libretto; (2)
several independent works combined to create a new work; or (3) collaborative
compositions conceived as such from the beginning. <br></p>

<p>Compilations may be entered on a single
record, or they may be entered as collections. <br></p>

<p>Take note of the following fields when
cataloging compilations. <br></p>

<p><b>Composer/Author (100)</b><span><br>The composer is always <b>Compilations</b>.</span> <br>

</p><p><b>Additional personal name (700)</b><span><br>The name of the compiler can be added with
the function <b>Editor</b>.</span><span><br><br>If you have a compilation, enter the
composer(s) of the original material and select the function <b>Composer
cross-reference</b>. Enter the composer(s) of the new material and select the
function <b>Co-composer</b>.</span> <br></p>

<p><span>If you have a pasticcio, do not enter
composers as a composer cross-references. Instead, enter all composers as <b>Co-composer</b>s.</span></p>



<p><b>Standardized title (240)</b><span><br>Enter the standardized title of the source
in hand. For pasticcios, add <b>Excerpts</b> or <b>Arrangement</b> as
appropriate.</span> <br></p>

<p><b>Language code (041)</b><span><br>For the field <b>Language of text</b>, enter
the language of the source in hand. If appropriate, the language of the
original work can be entered in <b>Language of original text</b>.</span>

</p><p><b>Subject heading (650)</b><span><br>The first subject heading should be <b>Compilations</b>
and/or <b>Pasticcios</b>. The second should be the genre of the source in hand.
If you have excerpts, the genre of the excerpt can be added. <b>Collaborative
compositions</b> is also an option. </span>

</p><p><b>Description summary (520)</b><br>Use this field to describe in general the
nature of the source.<i><br>Example</i>:<br>Act 1 by Amadei, act 2 by Bononcini, overture and act
3 by Händel</p>



<p><b>Alternate title (730)</b><span><br>Enter the standardized title of the
original piece(s), adding <b>Excerpts</b> or <b>Arrangement</b> as appropriate.
You can also enter ossia titles.</span>

</p>

<p><b>Catalog of works (690)</b><br>You can enter the catalog of works number
for both the compilation and the original works. <br></p>

<p><b>Text incipit (031)</b><br>Enter the text of the source in hand. If
known, enter the original text in brackets. <br>

</p><p><b>General note (500)</b><br>Always use a note for clarification,
especially if the works of separate composers are involved. This ensures that
the composers are matched to the works used in the compilation. <br></p>

<p><b>Note on performance (518)</b><br>Performances should be noted only as they
relate to the compilation itself. 

</p><p><br></p><p><b>Examples of compilations</b>:

</p><p>230001408: Cantata made from opera arias
with newly composed recitatives</p>

<p>702000623: Suite made from parts of an
opera</p>

<p>700007222: Several works by a single
composer used to create a new cantata </p>

<p>702000642, 702000643: Several works by
several composers used to create a new suite</p>

<p>452505748: An opera pasticcio consisting of
3 acts by 3 different composers</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><br></b></p>

<h3>Cataloging parodies</h3>

<p>A parody is a composition based on
pre-existing material that results in a new work. In the 19th
century, the term gains a satirical flavor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>The record 150205470 will be used as an
example.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Composer
(100)</b></p>

<p>Enter the composer of the music for the
source in hand.<br></p><ul><li>Weyse,
Christoph Ernst Friedrich

</li></ul><p><b>Additional
personal name (700)</b></p>

<p>Enter the composer of the pre-existing
material and select the function Composer cross-reference.</p>

<ul><li>Rossini,
Gioachino</li></ul>

<p><b>Standardized
title (240)</b></p>

<p>Enter the standardized title of the source
in hand.</p>

<ul><li>Dannemark
hellige lyd</li></ul>

<p><b>Additional
title (730)</b></p>

<p>Enter the title of the pre-existing
material. Add Excerpts as appropriate. Do not use Arrangement or Variations.</p>

<ul><li>Tancredi.
Excerpts</li></ul>

<p><b><span>Subject
heading (650)<br>
</span></b>Enter Parodies as the first subject heading. Enter
the genre of the source in hand for the second, and the genre of the
pre-existing material as the third.</p>

<ul><li>Parodies</li><li>National
anthems</li><li>Operas</li></ul>



<p><b>Language
code (041)</b></p>

<p>Enter the language for the source in hand
in the field Language of text. Enter the language of the pre-existing material
in the field Language of original text.</p>

<ul><li>Danish</li><li>Italian</li></ul>

<p><b>Text incipits (031)</b></p>

<p>Enter the text incipit of the source in
hand. If the original text is known, enter it in brackets.</p>

<ul><li>Dannemark
hellige lyd</li><li>[Di
tanti palpiti]</li></ul>

<p><b>Other fields</b></p>

<p>All other fields, such as performance
information, should relate only to the source in hand.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b>

</p><h4>Cataloging insertion arias<br></h4>

<p>Operas that include insertion arias (also called
suitcase arias or interpolated arias) should be cataloged with at least three
records: a parent record (collection record) for the opera as a whole, a record
for the original movements of the opera (which will contain most of the incipits),
and a record for each of the inserts.</p>

<p><span>Inserts that are separated from a larger work should
be cataloged separately. A link to the work into which it was inserted can be
indicated in the field <b>Related source (787</b>).</span></p>

<p>The usual rules apply when creating the parent record
and the record for the main opera. Please observe the following when cataloging
the insert. Note that all fields (such as date of composition and scoring)
pertain to the insertion only. </p>

<p><b>Composer (100)</b>: Composer of the insertion</p>

<p><b>Additional name (700)</b>: Composer of the larger
work, such as an opera</p><b>

</b><p><b>Standardized title (240)</b>: Title of the
insertion, or the name of the opera followed by Excerpts</p>

<p><span><b>Additional title (730)</b>: Title of the larger
work, plus the subheading <b>Inserts</b> </span></p>

<p><b>Subject heading (650)</b>: Enter three: Insertions,
the genre of the insertion, and the genre of the larger work</p>

<p><span><b>Related source (787)</b>: </span><span>Indicate
the the larger work
into which this piece was inserted and select the relationship type<b> Insert in</b>. Add
a brief remark in the field <b>Note </b>to explain the nature of the insert, such
as where it is located within the larger work.</span></p>

<p><b>General note (500)</b>: Any additional information
can be added to make the relationship of the insert within the larger work (if
known) clear.</p>



<p></p><h3>Cataloging
mixed materials (manuscripts and printed items stored together)</h3>

<p>It is not
uncommon for manuscript and printed items to be found together in the same
folder or with the same shelfmark: for example, a printed score with
handwritten parts, or a group of printed parts together with some handwritten
ones.</p>

<p>Always
strive to catalog the printed material in a separate record, because it is
possible that other libraries have copies of the same edition. Create one
record for the printed item, add your holdings, and create another record for
the manuscript materials. Use the field <b>Related source (787)</b> to point from one record to the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If it is
not feasible to create an adequate record for the printed material, proceed as
follows: Catalog your material using a manuscript template. In the material
description section, describe the manuscript materials. Add an additional
material group, and describe the printed materials. 

</p><p></p>


<p>

</p><h3>Cataloging music in periodicals</h3>

<span>There are two ways to catalog periodicals that contain
music: as a collection or as a single work. In either case, the title of the
periodical, with the issue number and year, is entered in the field <b>Additional
title (730)</b>.<br><br></span>

<p><b>Collections</b><span> can
be appropriate when the periodical consists of all or mostly music and the item
was collected and preserved as a whole. Holdings are attached to the collection
level. Individual entries are created for each piece in the issue.<br><i>Example</i>:<br>1001097294: January issue
(precise year unknown) of the <i>Kleine Pianoforte-Bibliothek</i>, containing 5
pieces. There is one record for the collection parent record, and five
individual entries for each piece. <br></span><br></p>



<p><b>Single works</b><span> can
be appropriate when works were included as insertions or additions to
periodicals without a notated music focus. Frequently, such items are preserved
outside of their original publication context.<br>
<i>Examples</i>:&nbsp; <br>991018149: "The Pantheon" published in <i>The Lady's Magazine</i>, August 1784<br>990042111: "L'amour folâtrant l'autre jour"
published in <i>Nouveau Mercure galant</i>, May
1679</span></p>

<p></p>

<h3><b><br></b>Cataloging
music in non-music publications</h3>

<p><span>RISM includes music found in printed publications
that are not primarily music documents. The focus of the RISM record is nevertheless
the music.<br><br>
<i>Example</i>: <br>
990026614: 3 songs by John Isaac Hawkins that were published in Charles Willson
Peale's <i>Discourse introductory to a
course of lectures on the science of nature </i>(1800).<br>
<b>Composer/Author (100)</b>: The composer of the music<br><b>Additional Personal Name (700)</b>: The author
of the book, with the indicator <b>other</b><br><b>
Title on source (245)</b>: The title of the book<br><b>Standardized title (240)</b>: A standardized
title according to RISM rules, such as <b>3
Songs</b></span><span><br><b>Physical description (300)</b>: A description
of the music, such as <b>1 score: 5 p.&nbsp; <br></b></span><br>Individual entries are then created for
each piece, following normal RISM rules.<br></p><p>

</p><p><br></p><h3>Cataloging libretti<br></h3><p>Please observe the following
when cataloging libretti.</p>



<p><b>Composer/Author (100):</b> Enter the author of the
libretto. Do not use this field for the composer of the music.&nbsp; <br></p><p><b>Additional personal name (700):</b> A useful function is
"conceptor," such as the author of a play that a libretto was based
on. Only enter a composer's name as a cross-reference if named on the source.</p>



<p><b>Additional institution (710):</b> Do not forget to index the
name of the publisher (for printed libretti).</p>



<p><b>Standardized title (240):</b> The fields "Arrangement
statement" and "Key or mode" are not relevant here. If the
libretto includes notated music, indicate the key in the music incipit (031)
only. <br></p><p><b>Additional title (730):</b> If the libretto was based on
a book or play, the title of the original work can be entered here.</p>



<p><b>Subject heading (650):</b> Enter the name of the genre
for which the libretto was written, if known (such as “Operas” or “Cantatas”).
"Librettos" is not necessary.</p>



<p><b>Language code (041):</b> Use the field "Language
of text" only if the libretto contains notated music with words.</p>



<p><b>Source type (593):</b> Select either "Libretto,
handwritten" or "Libretto, printed."</p>



<p><b>Physical description: Format, extent (300):</b> Use the phrase "text
document" to describe the format of the libretto. An example would be: 1 text document: viii, 27. p.</p><p><br></p>

<p></p><p>


	
	
	
	


</p><h3>Cataloging treatises</h3>
<p>

</p><p><span>When cataloging treatises, the field <b>Format, extent (300 $a)</b> should
generally include "text document" as the format. <br><br>
Appropriate subject headings for treatises include the following:</span></p><p></p><ul><li><b>Treatises</b></li><li><b>Writings</b></li><li><b>Music theory</b></li><li><b>Theory of harmony</b></li><li><b>Tutors (inst.)</b>: Includes methods and schools</li><li><b>Tutors (voc.)</b>: Includes methods and schools</li><li><b>Contrapuntal studies (inst./voc.)</b></li><li><b>Solfeggios (voc.)</b></li><li><b>Solfeggios (inst.)</b></li><li><b>Scales (inst./voc.)</b><b> <br></b></li></ul><p>

</p><p>Additional subject headings may be added.</p>

<p></p><p>
