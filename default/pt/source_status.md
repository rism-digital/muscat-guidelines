### Record status

The **Record status** indicates whether the records in Sources are published or unpublished. Only published records are available in the public RISM catalogs and open data. The status can be changed manually. The record status is applied to each record individually, regardless of the publication status of other records it may be linked to (such as in a collection).

The record status only applies to records created for musical sources, not for other areas of Muscat (such as authority files).

#### Published

Records from Muscat with the status **Published** are available in the public RISM catalogs and open data. All new Muscat records are automatically set to **Published**.

#### Unpublished

Records with the status **Unpublished** are withheld from publication. Some RISM contributors wish to keep this status until a project is complete, or individuals might want to wait until an item is fully cataloged before publishing it (such as with extensive records that have lots of incipits or individual entries).

Use this status judiciously. It is not good practice to unpublish records that were once publicly available, nor is it ideal to keep records unpublished for a very long time.

Multiple records can be published at once by adding them to a folder and publishing the contents of the folder.
