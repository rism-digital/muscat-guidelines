# Templates

Muscat offers template for different sources. The template offers only those fields that are needed for the source in hand.

**Copying existing records**

In addition to selecting different templates, you can copy an existing record. There are two ways to do this.

From the template selection screen: simply enter the RISM number in the field "Create from existing source." You will then see a copy of the record in the editing mode and from there you can make any changes to the record that you need. The copied record will automatically receive a new RISM ID number upon saving.

Alternately, you can copy a record in the viewing mode by clicking on the "Duplicate" button in the sidebar on the right.
