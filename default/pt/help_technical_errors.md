### Technical problems

#### 1. Things aren't working!

Do not despair! If you are having problems, first always make sure you have the most recent version of Firefox or Chrome; you might need to update your browser. Then, try clearing the cache. There are several ways to do this, depending on your computer:
- Hold down the Shift key and left-click the Reload button
- Press "Ctrl + F5" or press "Ctrl + Shift + R" (Windows, Linux)
- Press "Command + Shift + R" (Mac)

#### 2. I can't save my work.

Make sure you are using either Firefox or Chrome. Internet Explorer will not let you save anything!

#### 3. The fields stretch all the way across a page and cut into other text.

This might be a screen resolution issue. Muscat works best on screens that are at least 1366 x 768 pixels. Other resolutions might lead to display issues.

#### 4. I can't scroll down the screen.

This also might be a screen resolution issue. See #3, above.

#### 5. My screen is gray and all I see is an hourglass.

This happens when you are searching in the indexes. Check to see if another window is open. From that window, navigate back to the main screen.

#### 6. My incipit seems to have stalled.

Try clicking the "refresh" arrows, or save your record and try entering the incipit again.

#### 7. I get the error message: "Error saving page: this is a stale version"

This means that while you were editing, someone else also began editing the record and saved before you did. Try to remember your changes, close the record, and open it again.
