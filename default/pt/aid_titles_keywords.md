## Standardized titles – Subject headings

This section refers to cataloging situations where genres are used as standardized titles (refer to the guidelines for **Standardized title (240)**). In many cases, the **Standardized title** and the **Subject heading (650)** will be identical, such as with _Symphonies_. In other cases, however, a corresponding, rather than identical, subject heading is used.

Differences can arise in the following situations: If the same subject heading applies to vocal and instrumental genres, you will see the words (**voc.**) or (**inst.**) after the term in parentheses. Specifications such as (dances) or ( stage) may also be added in parentheses after the main term.

Below are some examples, followed by correspondences for the following kinds of standardized titles:

- General instrumental and vocal music
- Sacred vocal music
- Music for the stage, theater, etc.
- Exercises, studies, schools, lessons
- Dances

Here are some examples for special situations:

1. A chorale arrangement where the text incipit is known:   
   You don't need this list! Use the text incipit as the standardized title and select **Arrangement**. Enter the subject heading **Chorale arrangements**.

2. A chorale arrangement where the text incipit is unknown:   
   Use **Chorale arrangements** as both the standardized title and subject heading.

3. A potpourri where you know that the music comes from a single opera:  
   You don't need this list! Use the name of the opera as the standardized title and select **Excerpts** and ** Arrangement**. Enter the subject headings **Potpourris** and **Operas** (or **Operettas**, etc. as appropriate).

4. A potpourri where you know that the music comes from several operas:  
   Use **Potpourri** as the standardized title. Enter the names of the operas in the field **Additional title (730)**. For the subject heading, enter **Potpourris** and **Operas** (or **Operettas**, etc. as appropriate).

5. A potpourri where you do not know what operas the music is from:  
   Use **Potpourris** as both the standardized title and subject heading.

6. A wind arrangement of music from a stage work where the name of the stage work is known:  
   Use the name of the stage work as the standardized title and select **Arrangement**. Enter the subject heading **Wind music**.

7. A wind arrangement of music from a stage work where the name of the stage work is unknown:  
   Use **Wind music** as both the standardized title and subject heading.

8. For **sketches** of unknown compositions, use the distinctive title plus the subject heading **Sketches**. For sketches of known compositions, please use the distinctive title of the work and **Sketches** as second subject heading.

9. In cases of complete uncertainty, such as unknown scoring, enter **Pieces** as the standardized title and **Pieces** as the subject heading.

The following list gives an idea of what standardized titles have a corresponding subject heading. Please note that this list is not comprehensive.
