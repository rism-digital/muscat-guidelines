### Publishing, printing, and production information (260)

The field **Publishing, printing, and production information** is for information relating to the publication, printing, distribution, issue, release, or production for all types of sources. In all subfields here, indicate editorial additions and completions with square brackets. Place a question mark after an uncertain piece of information.

For printed music: If the original publishing information is covered by a label showing later information or otherwise crossed out or altered (including stamps), and new information is provided in its place, enter the new information in this field. If you can read the original publishing information or if the original publishing information is otherwise available, you may also enter it by repeating the field. An explanatory note in the field **General note (500)** may be necessary to clarify the presence of a label or multiple imprints. If a label or stamp is somewhere else on the page, record it in the holdings information.

#### Place (260 $a)

For printed material, enter the place of publication as given on the source. Multiple places of publication can be entered by clicking on the plus sign (+) to the left of the text field. For manuscripts, enter the place where a manuscript was produced if it is indicated on the source.

If the place is not identified on a print, enter **[s.l.]**. For manuscripts, leave blank.

#### Publisher, copyist (260 $b)

For printed material, enter the name of the publisher, publishing company, importer, or distributor as given on the source.

For manuscripts, enter the name of the copyist as it appears on the source.

Enter the standardized forms of the names in the fields **Additional personal name (700)** or **Additional institution (710)**. Enter the name of the printer or press as given on the source.

If the name of the publisher or distributor is not identified on a print, enter **[s.n.]**. (Do not index [s.n.] as an additional institution). For manuscripts, leave blank.

#### Date (260 $c)

Enter the date of the source. Use Arabic numerals (such as 1624 instead of MDCXXIV). Keep in mind that this field is for the date of the material source itself, not for the work notated in the source. If the source contains an obvious error (such as a typographical error), enter the correct date in this field.

For manuscripts: Always try to give a date, even if it is approximate. If you have a month, day, and year, write it in this form: YYYY-MM-DD.

You may indicate approximate dates in your cataloging language by using the following: **ca.** for circa, **before**, and **after**. Try to indicate the date as exactly as possible. If you are uncertain, use a date range that corresponds to a non-specific period, such as the eighteenth century or the end of the seventeenth century. See the table below.

For printed items: If you have a print but it is undated, either enter an approximate date in square brackets or enter **[s.d.]**. Make an effort to supply a reasonable date range for an undated print, such as by using the life dates of the composer or arranger as a _terminus post quem_, or the active years of a publisher.

Note that for manuscripts, dates are given without square brackets because manuscripts are rarely dated. Printed materials, by contrast, are more likely to include a date so any editorial guess should be in square brackets.

Other dates may be indicated as on the source. Use question marks to indicate uncertain information.

For approximate periods of time, enter a range of years based on the following standardized date ranges:


| **For the period**            | **Enter this range of dates** |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| beginning of the 18th century | 1700-1710                     |
| middle of the 18th century    | 1740-1760                     |
| end of the 18th century       | 1790-1799                     |

| 18th century, 1st half        | 1700-1749                     |
| 18th century, 2nd half        | 1750-1799                     |
| 18th century                  | 1700-1799                     |

**Obsolete procedures**: Older RISM cataloging guidelines allowed certain coded date formats. This practice was discontinued with the introduction of Muscat. The obsolete date formats are the following, with their meaning in parentheses:
- 1782a (before 1782)
- 1782c (ca. 1782)
- 1782p (after 1782)
- 18.in (beginning of the 18th century)
- 18.me (middle of the 18th century)
- 18.ex (end of the 18th century)
- 18.1t (first third of the 18th century)
- 18.3q (third quarter of the 18th century)
- 18.2d (second half of the 18th century)
- 18.sc (18th century)
- 18/19 (18th or 19th century)

Furthermore, previous cataloging programs had two fields for dating. One was for numbers only and the second was a text field where numbers plus abbreviations such as _+, ca., ante, post,_ and _18.sc_ or text such as _Easter 1805_ or _?1745?_ could be entered. Some legacy records, therefore, display two date indications, such as _1806 (1806 ca.)_. Dates written in the format XX.XX.XXXX are interpreted as DD.MM.YYYY.
