### Parts held and extent (590)

The field **Parts held and extent** indicates which parts are held and their foliation/pagination.

#### Parts held (590 $a)

**Required if source contains parts.**

Enter parts held and number of parts with reference to the RISM instrument abbreviation list. If you wish, you may use the designations that appear on the source if they vary from the standardized RISM abbreviation.

The first letter of instrumental parts is in lowercase and vocal parts uppercase. The order for naming parts is as follows and from the highest to the lowest range:

- Solo vocal parts. Begin the field with **Solo:**
- Chorus vocal parts. Begin the field with **Coro:**
- Solo instruments
- Strings
- Basso continuo/thoroughbass
- Woodwinds
- Brass
- Other instruments

If no further details of the part designations are available, write the English phrase: **no further indication**

Special cases:

- Figured bass: If you have a figured bass, enter the instrument followed by **.fig**, such as **b.fig**, **bc.fig**, **org.fig**, etc. (but see the tables in the section **Figured bass in scores and/or parts** for guidance with related fields).
- Instrument not on the RISM instrument abbreviation list: write out the instrument in full.
- Unusual instruments, designations, or tunings (such as **cor in D\|x**) may be written out in full; however, in the field **Total scoring (594)**, try to standardize the instrument to RISM's instrument abbreviation list if possible (such as **cor in E\|b**).
- Example: **tr 1 and 2** If a part contains the music for multiple instruments, use **and**.
- In partbooks of the 15th and 16th centuries, it is sometimes the case that a part appears in a partbook that differs from the partbookâ€™s label, such as a Tenor 2 part that is printed in a Quinta vox (V 5) partbook. In this field, you can indicate where each part is found by using an equals sign.  
  Example:  
  Partbooks are S, A, T, B, V 5. V 5 contains a T 2 part.  
  S, A, T, B, V 5 (= T 2)  
  See also the field **Total scoring (594)** on how to enter the total instrumentation.


#### Extent (parts) (590 $b)

Enter the number of folios, pages, leaves, or gatherings. Use only one method of enumeration. Choose among the following abbreviations:

- **f** for folio
- **p** for page
- **lvs** for leaves (sheets)
- **fds** for folds (gatherings)

Indicate other units (such as the conversion from folios to pages) in the field **General note (500)**.

You may also indicate single pages or folios within a manuscript collection, such as **p. 5-6** or **f. 4r-4v**. 5-6</strong> or **f. 4r-4v**.

##### Examples
There are two different ways list the parts.

*Example 1*: One instrumental family per line with a comma separating the instruments. The field must be repeated for each family.

**Parts held (590 $a)**: Solo: S 1, 2 (2x), A, T, B  
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 p.

**Parts held (590 $a)**: Coro: S, A, T B  
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 4, 4, 4, 4 p.

**Parts held (590 $a)**: vl 1, 2, vla, vlc, b (= bc)  
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 4, 4, 3, 4, 2 p.

**Parts held (590 $a)**: ob 1, 2, cl 1, 2 in B\|b  
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 2, 2, 2, 2 p.

**Parts held (590 $a)**: tr 1 and 2 in B\|b   
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 2 p.

**Parts held (590 $a)**: org (incpl)  
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 8 p.

*Example 2*: Everything on one line with a comma separating the instruments and a semicolon separating the instrument families (but this can be hard to follow if many parts are present)

**Parts held (590 $a)**: Solo: S (2x), A, T, Bariton, B; Coro: S; vl 1, 2, vla, vlc, cb (incpl); fl 1, 2, ob; cor 1 and 2  
**Extent (parts) (590 $b)**: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3; 3; 5, 5, 3, 2, 1; 4, 3, 4; 2 f.

#### Additional information

Additional information (brief remarks) about such things as the number or incompleteness of parts can be added in parentheses directly after the part designation. Use the following conventions:

- If you have multiple copies of the same part, write the number and then include the extent for each part. Example: **S (2x)** Example: **S (2x)**
- **(= bc)**: part is a basso continuo part
- **(incpl)**: part is incomplete
- Use a **/** (slash) to join two elements: **bc (2x/incpl)**
- If a part contains the music for multiple instruments, use **and**. Example: **tr 1 and 2**
- You can include the tuning: **cl 1, 2 in B\|b**
