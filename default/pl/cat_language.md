## Kod języka

Sekcja **Kod języka** określa użycie języka angielskiego i innych języków w Muscat.

### Use of English vs. other languages

English terminology or standardized English abbreviations are required in some fields. When English is required, it is indicated in the guidelines for the applicable field.

In other fields, non-English languages are permitted.

### Cataloging language

When English is not required, you may use what the guidelines refer to as your **cataloging language**. RISM allows the following cataloging languages: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

 Other languages are allowed as long as a summary is provided in one of the six cataloging languages. The guidelines always state when you cataloging language may be used.

In the guidelines that follow, the phrase "cataloging language" refers to the practice of using either one of these six languages or a different language plus a translation into one of the six.

Your cataloging language for Sources can be indicated in the field **Cataloging language (040 $b)**.

### Transliterations

National groups are responsible for determining what transliteration tables should be used when transliterating their language.
