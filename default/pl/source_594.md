### Total scoring (594)

The field **Total scoring** is used to indicate all of the voices or instruments that are needed to perform the piece. "Scoring" is also known as performing forces, medium of performance, or instrumentation (which here includes vocal parts).

While the field **Scoring summary** (240 $m) givies the scoring of a work in brief, the **Total scoring** gives the scoring of a work in full. The **Scoring summary** must therefore always correlate with the details you enter in this full description of the scoring.

The total scoring should be as complete as possible, regardless of whether the source in hand is complete.

#### Voice/instrument (594 $b)

**Required field.**

Enter the voices or instruments using RISM abbreviations. Use the autocomplete in this field to help you. An alphabetical list of abbreviations can be found in the RISM instrument abbreviations list. General instrumental designations (such as strings) are always in English and individual instruments are in Italian whenever possible. Other specific, regional instruments should be written in the original language.

Use upper case for vocal parts and lower case for other instrumental parts. Solo instruments begin with **iSol:**.

If the full scoring requirements are not given, or if your source is incomplete, the total scoring should be ascertained from the title, the material itself, or other reference works. If the scoring is not known, write **no indication**. Any uncertainty can be mentioned in more detail in the field **General note (500)**.

If you have a figured bass, enter the instrument as usual, such as **b**, **bc**, **org**, etc. (but see the tables in the section **Figured bass in scores and/or parts** for guidance with related fields).

For non-C instruments, standard tunings are listed in the abbreviation list. If the tuning in your source deviates from the standard tuning, please list the tuning in the source (see: **in A**). For instruments that are normally in C, "in C" does not need to be listed. If in doubt, list the tuning. Instrument tunings should be given in English. See **Appendix: Keys**.

If you have a piece with an instrumentation that differs from the label on the source, such music for the Tenor 2 voice in a Quinta vox (V 5) partbook, use the more specific instrumentation if available. If the music is lacks such an indication but you are able to determine the actual voice with certainty, you are permitted to enter the actual voice. If there is any uncertainty, simply enter the part as on the source.

When trying to decide between similar terms, it is usually best to go with what is on the source. If the name of the instrument in your source deviates from the RISM abbreviation, you may write the term as on the source in the field **General note (500)**.

List the scoring in the following order:

- Solo voices
- Chorus
- Solo instruments
- Strings
- Woodwinds
- Brass
- Plucked instruments
- Percussion
- Keyboard instruments
- Basso continuo

List parts from the highest to the lowest range. Enter one instrument per line. Add alternative scoring possibilities to the original requirements in parentheses.

_MARC note: The field 594 $b is exported as 594 $a._

#### Number (594 $c)

Indicate the total number of parts here. If a piece includes two parts for the same instrument, enter the single instrument in the field **Scoring** and **2** in the field **Number**.

The number refers to the music, not to the number of people needed to play the music or the number of parts preserved in your source. For example, "Coro S" and "2" means that the soprano part is divided into soprano 1 and soprano 2.  Likewise, "vl" and "2" means that the violins are divided into violin 1 and violin 2.

For incomplete sources or if the number is unknown, an **X** can be entered instead of a number.

##### Examples

- For a piece with violin 1 and violin 2:  
  vl  
  2
- Only 1 viola part:  
  vla  
  1
- Oboe 1 and oboe 2:  
  ob  
  2
- Only 1 clarinet part:  
  cl  
  1
- French horns present but it is not known how many: cor X
