### RISM instrument abbreviations

The section **RISM instrument abbreviations** contains the standardized list of abbreviations used by RISM to designate instruments, including vocal instruments.

In general, names of instrument families (such as _strings_) are in English and names of individual instruments are abbreviated based on their name in Italian. Voice parts are written using capital letters and non-vocal instruments are written using lower-case letters.

Names of regional instruments not on the list should be written out in full in the original language.
