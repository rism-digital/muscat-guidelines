### RISM series (510)

The field **RISM series (510)** is an administrative field that indicates that the source in hand was originally described in one of the publications belonging to RISM's Series A/I or B.

This field was automatically filled out when entries from RISM's book publications were imported. Automated imports were carried out for A/I and B/I.

This field is also used if records are entered by hand for sources described in RISM's series, particularly Series B, but also Series A/I in cases where the original A/I record is split into multiple records. In cases of record splits, the RISM series number is carried over to all new records.

This field may not be used as a cross-reference to other sources or to indicate that a source is absent from a RISM publication. For the former, see **RISM series A/I and B reference (596)** and for the latter see **Bibliographic reference (691)**.
